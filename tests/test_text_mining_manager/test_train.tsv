27593208	no cancer	-1	0	Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of multiple sweet mogrosides in the fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii and its marketed sweeteners. A high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of eight major sweet mogrosides in different batches of the fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii and its marketed sweeteners. The sample preparation procedure and chromatographic and mass spectrographic conditions were optimized. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a reversed-phase Poroshell 120 SB C18 column in 10.0 min with gradient elution with acetonitrile and water, both of which contained 0.1% formic acid. The multiple reaction monitoring scanning mode was employed for quantification in the negative ion mode. The developed method was validated with acceptable linearity (r(2) = 0.9984-0.9998) over a wide concentration range, precision (relative standard deviations = 1.09-3.91%), stability (relative standard deviations = 1.21-3.01%), and recovery in the range of 91.22-106.58% (relative standard deviations ≤ 3.79%) under optimum conditions. The proposed method was demonstrated to be simple, rapid, specific and reliable and was successfully applied for the quality control of the fruits of S. grosvenorii and its marketed sweeteners.

27576331	no cancer	-1	0	How is the ultrasound in rheumatology used, implemented, and applied in Latin American centers? Results from a multicenter study. This study aimed to perform an overview of how ultrasound (US) is being used, implemented, and applied in rheumatologic centers in Latin America (LA). A retrospective, multicenter 1-year experience study was undertaken. Eighteen centers from eight countries were involved. The following information were collected: demographic data, indication to perform an US examination, physician that required the examination, and the anatomical region required for the examination. A total of 7167 patients underwent an US examination. The request for US examinations came most frequently from their own institution (5981 (83.45 %)) than from external referral (1186 (16.55 %)). The services that more frequently requested an US examination were rheumatology 5154 (71.91 %), followed by orthopedic 1016 (14.18 %), and rehabilitation 375 (5.23 %). The most frequently scanned area was the shoulder in 1908 cases (26.62 %), followed by hand 1754 (24.47 %), knee 1518 (21.18 %), ankle 574 (8.01 %), and wrist 394 (5.50 %). Osteoarthritis was the most common disease assessed (2279 patients (31.8 %)), followed by rheumatoid arthritis (2125 patients (29.65 %)), psoriatic arthritis (869 patients (12.1 %)), painful shoulder syndrome (545 (7.6 %)), connective tissue disorders (systemic sclerosis 339 (4.7 %), polymyositis/dermatomyositis 107 (1.4 %), Sjögren's syndrome 60 (0.8 %), and systemic lupus erythematosus 57 (0.8 %)). US evaluation was more frequently requested for diagnostic purposes (3981 (55.5 %)) compared to follow-up studies (2649 (36.9 %)), research protocols (339 (4.73 %)), and invasive guided procedures (198 (2.76 %)). US registered increasing applications in rheumatology and highlighted its positive impact in daily clinical practice. US increases the accuracy of the musculoskeletal clinical examination, influence the diagnosis, and the disease management.
27600056	no cancer	-1	0	Liver transplantation for acute liver failure accompanied by severe acute pancreatitis. The role of liver transplantation (LT) in acute liver failure (ALF) complicated by severe acute pancreatitis is still unclear. We here report a case of deceased-donor LT for idiopathic ALF accompanied by severe acute pancreatitis. A 58-year-old man with no history of liver disease presented with idiopathic ALF and acute pancreatitis. After careful consideration, he received a liver from a deceased donor. Following surgery, the patient's liver function rapidly reverted to normal level and the acute pancreatitis simultaneously subsided. The patient later developed a pancreatic pseudocyst, which was treated successfully with combination interventional radiology. LT can be considered for ALF associated with severe acute pancreatitis if there is no clinical evidence of an absolute contraindication for organ transplantation, such as systemic or local infection. Moreover, we recommend a close follow-up by ultrasonography to allow early detection and treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts following surgery.
21502544	cancer	162	1	Cetuximab plus irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer: updated analysis of overall survival according to tumor KRAS and BRAF mutation status. The addition of cetuximab to irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was shown to reduce the risk of disease progression and increase the chance of response in patients with KRAS wild-type disease. An updated survival analysis, including additional patients analyzed for tumor mutation status, was undertaken. Patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI with or without cetuximab. DNA was extracted from additional slide-mounted tumor samples previously used to assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Clinical outcome according to the tumor mutation status of KRAS and BRAF was assessed in the expanded patient series. The ascertainment rate of patients analyzed for tumor KRAS status was increased from 45% to 89%, with mutations detected in 37% of tumors. The addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI in patients with KRAS wild-type disease resulted in significant improvements in overall survival (median, 23.5 v 20.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.796; P = .0093), progression-free survival (median, 9.9 v 8.4 months; HR, 0.696; P = .0012), and response (rate 57.3% v 39.7%; odds ratio, 2.069; P < .001) compared with FOLFIRI alone. Significant interactions between KRAS status and treatment effect were noted for all key efficacy end points. KRAS mutation status was confirmed as a powerful predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI. BRAF tumor mutation was a strong indicator of poor prognosis. The addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI as first-line therapy improves survival in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC. BRAF tumor mutation is an indicator of poor prognosis.
27590876	no cancer	-1	0	Significantly greater triglyceridemia in Black African compared to White European men following high added fructose and glucose feeding: a randomized crossover trial. Black African (BA) populations are losing the cardio-protective lipid profile they historically exhibited, which may be linked with increasing fructose intakes. The metabolic effects of high fructose diets and how they relate to blood lipids are documented for Caucasians, but have not been described in BA individuals. The principle objective of this pilot study was to assess the independent impacts of high glucose and fructose feeding in men of BA ancestry compared to men of White European (WE) ancestry on circulating triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Healthy males, aged 25-60 years, of BA (n = 9) and WE (n = 11) ethnicity were randomly assigned to 2 feeding days in a crossover design, providing mixed nutrient meals with 20 % total daily caloric requirements from either added glucose or fructose. Circulating TG, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, insulin and C-peptide were measured over two 24-h periods. Fasting TGs were lower in BAs than WEs on the fructose feeding day (p < 0.05). There was a trend for fasting TG concentrations 24 h following fructose feeding to increase in both BA (baseline median fasting: 0.80, IQR 0.6-1.1 vs 24-h median post-fructose: 1.09, 0.8-1.4 mmol/L; p = 0.06) and WE (baseline median fasting 1.10, IQR 0.9-1.5 vs 24-h median post-fructose: 1.16, IQR 0.96-1.73 mmol/L; p = 0.06). Analysis within ethnic group demonstrated that in TG iAUC was significantly higher in BA compared to WE on both glucose (35, IQR 11-56 vs -4, IQR -10-1 mmol/L/min; p = 0.004) and fructose (48, IQR 15-68 vs 13, IQR -7-38 mmol/L/min; p = 0.04). Greater suppression of postprandial NEFA was evident in WE than BA after glucose feeding (-73, IQR -81- -52 vs -26, IQR -48- -3 nmol/L/min; p = 0.001) but there was no ethnic difference following fructose feeding. Understanding the metabolic effects of dietary acculturation and Westernisation that occurs in Black communities is important for developing prevention strategies for chronic disease development. These data show postprandial hypertriglyceridemia following acute feeding of high added fructose and glucose in BA men, compared to WE men, may contribute to metabolic changes observed during dietary acculturation and Westernisation. The study was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02533817 .
27584025	no cancer	-1	0	Cancer immunotherapy: new applications in urologic oncology. Over the last 10 years, harnessing of the immune system to attack tumors has been one of the major breakthroughs in cancer, primarily through the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This review will summarize current immune treatments in urologic malignancies and ongoing trials with novel combinations and in different disease settings. Patients with urologic malignancies such as kidney and bladder cancer have benefited significantly from these advances with the approval of ICIs in both of these diseases. In addition, older immune therapies have also been used in these malignancies. For example, kidney cancers, which are traditionally unresponsive to chemotherapy, can respond to immune activation by cytokines. Prostate cancers, too, have immune therapies, such as sipuleucel-T, a dendritic cell vaccine. Combining ICIs with these older treatments as well as with molecularly targeted therapies and chemotherapies are currently underway. The ICIs have changed the way urologic malignancies are treated and newer combinations are likely to alter the therapeutic landscape in these diseases dramatically in the coming years.
27592101	no cancer	-1	0	Assistive technology evaluations: Remote-microphone technology for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The goal of this study was to conduct assistive technology evaluations on 12 children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to evaluate the potential benefits of remote-microphone (RM) technology. A single group, within-subjects design was utilized to explore individual and group data from functional questionnaires and behavioral test measures administered, designed to assess school- and home-based listening abilities, once with and once without RM technology. Because some of the children were unable to complete the behavioral test measures, particular focus was given to the functional questionnaires completed by primary teachers, participants, and parents. Behavioral test measures with and without the RM technology included speech recognition in noise, auditory comprehension, and acceptable noise levels. The individual and group teacher (n=8-9), parent (n=8-9), and participant (n=9) questionnaire ratings revealed substantially less listening difficulty when RM technology was used compared to the no-device ratings. On the behavioral measures, individual data revealed varied findings, which will be discussed in detail in the results section. However, on average, the use of the RM technology resulted in improvements in speech recognition in noise (4.6dB improvement) in eight children, higher auditory working memory and comprehension scores (12-13 point improvement) in seven children, and acceptance of poorer signal-to-noise ratios (8.6dB improvement) in five children. The individual and group data from this study suggest that RM technology may improve auditory function in children with ASD in the classroom, at home, and in social situations. However, variability in the data and the inability of some children to complete the behavioral measures indicates that individualized assistive technology evaluations including functional questionnaires will be necessary to determine if the RM technology will be of benefit to a particular child who has ASD.
27589961	no cancer	-1	0	Overview of the interactive task in BioCreative V. Fully automated text mining (TM) systems promote efficient literature searching, retrieval, and review but are not sufficient to produce ready-to-consume curated documents. These systems are not meant to replace biocurators, but instead to assist them in one or more literature curation steps. To do so, the user interface is an important aspect that needs to be considered for tool adoption. The BioCreative Interactive task (IAT) is a track designed for exploring user-system interactions, promoting development of useful TM tools, and providing a communication channel between the biocuration and the TM communities. In BioCreative V, the IAT track followed a format similar to previous interactive tracks, where the utility and usability of TM tools, as well as the generation of use cases, have been the focal points. The proposed curation tasks are user-centric and formally evaluated by biocurators. In BioCreative V IAT, seven TM systems and 43 biocurators participated. Two levels of user participation were offered to broaden curator involvement and obtain more feedback on usability aspects. The full level participation involved training on the system, curation of a set of documents with and without TM assistance, tracking of time-on-task, and completion of a user survey. The partial level participation was designed to focus on usability aspects of the interface and not the performance per se In this case, biocurators navigated the system by performing pre-designed tasks and then were asked whether they were able to achieve the task and the level of difficulty in completing the task. In this manuscript, we describe the development of the interactive task, from planning to execution and discuss major findings for the systems tested.Database URL: http://www.biocreative.org.
27601942	no cancer	-1	0	Pre and post radiotherapy serum oxidant/antioxidant status in breast cancer patients: Impact of age, BMI and clinical stage of the disease. In this study the effects of radiation therapy (RT) on serum oxidant/antioxidant status in breast cancer patients and the impact of age, BMI and clinical stage of the disease on the aforementioned variables were investigated. RT that is used for cancer treatment is dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species. Eighty patients with breast cancer participated in this study and received RT at a dose of 50 Gy for 5 weeks. Blood samples were obtained in one day before and after the end of RT. Serum status of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were analyzed by spectrophotometry or ELISA and selenium (Se) level were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Paired t-test was used for comparing pre and post radiotherapy data. Before and after the radiotherapy, a significant increase in MDA level was observed, while a significant decrease in GPx activity, SOD, TAS and Se levels were found (p < 0.05). The level of the CAT enzyme had no significant changes (p = 0.568). The results showed some changes in the status of TAS, SOD and GPx which are associated with age, BMI and clinical stage of the disease. It seems that RT would have the potential to cause variations in the status of antioxidant/oxidant system. Although, some changes in variables were observed by sub-classification of the age, BMI and the disease stage, but it seems that these changes are not necessarily dependent to them.
27588204	no cancer	-1	0	Role of human milk oligosaccharides in Group B Streptococcus colonisation. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. The major risk factor for GBS disease is maternal and subsequent infant colonisation. It is unknown whether human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) protect against GBS colonisation. HMO production is genetically determined and linked to the Lewis antigen system. We aimed to investigate the association between HMOs and infant GBS colonisation between birth and postnatal day 90. Rectovaginal swabs were collected at delivery, as well as colostrum/breast milk, infant nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs at birth, 6 days and days 60-89 postpartum from 183 Gambian mother/infant pairs. GBS colonisation and serotypes were determined using culture and PCR. (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterise the mother's Lewis status and HMO profile in breast milk. Mothers who were Lewis-positive were significantly less likely to be colonised by GBS (X (2)=12.50, P<0.001). Infants of Lewis-positive mothers were less likely GBS colonised at birth (X (2)=4.88 P=0.03) and more likely to clear colonisation between birth and days 60-89 than infants born to Lewis-negative women (P=0.05). There was no association between Secretor status and GBS colonisation. In vitro work revealed that lacto-N-difucohexaose I (LNDFHI) correlated with a reduction in the growth of GBS. Our results suggest that HMO such as LNDFHI may be a useful adjunct in reducing maternal and infant colonisation and hence invasive GBS disease. Secretor status offers utility as a stratification variable in GBS clinical trials.

The accurate recording of findings in clinical medicolegal cases is important, yet the current J88 form used for this purpose in South Africa has been reported to have many flaws. In addition, there are reports of poor completion of the form, which could in part be due to its poor design and clarity. To describe the process that was undertaken to revise the current J88 form. A repetitive consultative process was used to revise the current J88 form and to obtain inputs from relevant government institutions. A brief outline of the changes that have been made to the current J88 form and the reasons why these changes were proposed by national experts is provided. The revised J88 form will provide clearer guidance to healthcare providers on the completion of necessary information in an expedited fashion. It is hoped that the form will soon be approved by the necessary government institutions.
27591409	no cancer	-1	0	Enhancing the informed consent process in psychiatric outpatients with a brief computer -based method. Informed consent is a key element of ethical clinical research. Those with mental disorders may be at risk for impaired consent capacity. Problems with procedures may also contribute to patient's ´difficulties in understanding consent forms. The present investigation explores if a brief technologically based information presentation of the informed consent process may enhance psychiatric patients understanding and satisfaction. In this longitudinal, within-participants comparison study, patients who initially were judged to lack capacity to make research decisions (n=41) and a control group (n=47) were followed up. Decisional capacity, willingness to participate and cognitive and clinical scores were assessed at baseline and after receiving the computer-assisted enhanced consent. With sufficient cueing, patients with impaired research-related decision-making capacity at baseline were able to display enough understanding of the consent form. Patient satisfaction and willingness to participate also increased at follow up. Implications of these results for clinical practice and medical research involving people with mental disorders are discussed.

Hypoxia has been reported to regulate osteoblastic differentiation of bone cells and cartilage development. However, information concerning the molecular mechanisms remains largely unknown. The expression of miR-429 was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. To test whether miR-429 directly regulate the expression level of ZFPM2 at transcription level, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed. Western blotting was performed to detect osteogenesis related protein expression. The cell proliferation, apoptosis, alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization were performed to assess the functions of miR-429 in vitro and in vivo the effects of miR-429 on fracture healing. Expression of miR-429 was increased in MC3T3-E1 cells treated with 200 μM CoCl2 by qRT-PCR, and overexpression of miR-429 promoted cell differentiation, and enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization. Luciferase reporter assays suggested that miR-429 directly targets the 3'UTR of ZFPM2. In addition, knockdown of ZFPM2 could phenocopy the effects of miR-429 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of ZFPM2 in miR-429-expressing MC3T3-E1 cells suppressed cell differentiation. Our results provide valuable insight into the potential role of hypoxia in regulation of osteoblastic cell differentiation.
27588055	no cancer	-1	0	Treatment of a giant arteriovenous malformation associated with intracranial aneurysm rupture during pregnancy: A case report. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) associated with aneurysm have rarely been reported in the literature. The present study reports the case of a 21-year-old pregnant female patient who presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and an intracranial hematoma located in the anterior end of the corpus callosum. Furthermore, an anterior cerebral aneurysm and an AVM were identified by digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. The aneurysm was clipped and the AVM was successfully removed by microsurgery. The diagnosis of AVM associated with an aneurysm was confirmed via intraoperative and postoperative pathological examinations. By performing a review of the current literature, issues and surgical considerations associated with AVM associated with aneurysm were analyzed.

27591135	no cancer	-1	0	Pregnancy complications in spontaneous and assisted conceptions of women with infertility and subfertility factors. A comprehensive review. In the literature, there is growing evidence that assisted reproductive techniques increase the risk of pregnancy complications in subfertile couples. Moreover, many concomitant preconception risk factors for subfertility are frequently present in the same subject and increase the risk of pregnancy complications. This review aimed to summarize in a systematic fashion the best current evidence regarding the effects of preconception maternal factors on maternal and neonatal outcomes. A literature search up to March 2016 was performed in IBSS, SocINDEX, Institute for Scientific Information, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. An evidence-based hierarchy was used to determine which articles to include and analyse. Available data show that the risk of pregnancy complications in spontaneous and assisted conceptions is likely multifactorial, and the magnitude of this risk is probably very different according specific subgroups of patients. Notwithstanding the only moderate level and quality of the available evidence, available data suggest that the presence and the treatment of specific preconception cofactors of subfertility should be always taken into account both in clinical practice and for scientific purposes.
27578261	no cancer	-1	0	Bacillus as a potential diagnostic marker for yellow tongue coating. Observation of tongue coating, a foundation for clinical diagnosis and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is a major indicator of the occurrence, development, and prognosis of disease. The biological basis of tongue diagnosis and relationship between the types and microorganisms of tongue coating remain elusive. Thirteen chronic erosive gastritis (CEG) patients with typical yellow tongue coating (YTC) and ten healthy volunteers with thin white tongue coating (WTC) were included in this study. Patients were provided a 2-course targeted treatment of a herbal medicine Ban Xia Xie Xin decoction, traditionally prescribed for CEG patients with YTC, to evaluate the relationship between tongue coating microbiota and diagnosis of CEG with typical YTC. The tongue coating segregation structure was determined using Illumina Miseq sequencing of the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacillus was significantly observed only in CEG patients with YTC, but not in patients who received the decoction. YTC (n = 22) and WTC (n = 29) samples were collected for bacterial culturing to illustrate the relationship between Bacillus and YTC. The Bacillus positivity rate of YTC samples was 72.7%; Bacillus was not observed in WTC samples. In conclusion, Bacillus was strongly associated with YTC.
27587702	no cancer	-1	0	On cross-conditional and fluctuation correlations in competitive RNA networks. In competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, different mRNAs targeted by the same miRNA can 'cross-talk' by absorbing miRNAs and relieving repression on the other mRNAs. This creates correlations in mRNA expression even without direct interaction. Most previous theoretical study of cross-talk has focused on correlations in stochastic fluctuations of mRNAs around their steady state values. However, the experimentally known examples of cross-talk do not involve single-cell fluctuations, but rather bulk tissue-level changes between conditions, such as due to differentiation or disease. In our study, we quantify for the first time both fluctuational and cross-conditional cross-talk in chemical kinetic models of miRNA-mRNA interaction networks. We study the parameter regions under which these different types of cross-talk arise, and how they are affected by network structure. We find that while a network may support both fluctuational and cross-conditional cross-talk, the parameter regimes under which each type of cross-talk tends to emerge are rather different. Consistent with previous studies, fluctuational cross-talk occurs when miRNA and mRNA expression levels are 'balanced', whereas cross-conditional cross-talk tends to emerge when average miRNA levels are high and average mRNA levels are low. Conversely, cross-conditional miRNA cross-talk-a little-discussed phenomenon-is greatest when miRNA levels are low and mRNA levels are high. We show that the parameter ranges where cross-talk is maximized can, to some degree, be predicted based on network structure. Indeed, we find that the dominant effect of network structure on correlations happens through the effect of network structure on the overall balance between miRNA and mRNA expression. However, it is not the only effect, as we find that the density of connections between miRNAs and mRNAs in larger networks increases cross-talk without altering the expression balance. Our results deepen the theoretical understanding of cross-talk in ceRNA networks, and have implications for the experimental identification of ceRNA cross-talk phenomena.

27582087	no cancer	-1	0	Long-term longitudinal modifications in mesopic microperimetry in early and intermediate age-related macular degeneration. To evaluate functional changes (retinal sensitivity and fixation characteristics) determined by microperimetry in patients with early and intermediate AMD over 6 years. Prospective, longitudinal follow-up (FU) study of 16 patients (29 eyes) with early and intermediate AMD (AREDS 2 and AREDS 3 classification). All eyes underwent: complete ophthalmic examination with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) determination, color fundus photo (CFP), optical coherence tomography and microperimetry. All CFP were evaluated by two retinal specialists masked to functional data for changes in severity of clinical features over the course of FU. Of 17 eyes graded as AREDS 2 at baseline, 14 (82.35 %) remained stable, and 3 (18.75 %) progressed to AREDS 3. Of 12 eyes graded as AREDS 3 at baseline, 10 remained stable (83.33 %), and 2 (16.67 %) progressed to AREDS 4. Mean BCVA significantly deteriorated in both AREDS 2 (p = 0.006) and AREDS 3 (p = 0.016), with greater decrease in AREDS 3 (p = 0.01)6. Mean retinal sensitivity (RS) significantly decreased over time in both AREDS 2 (p < 0.0001) and AREDS 3 group (p = 0.002), with greater decrease in AREDS 3 (p = 0.006). The mean number of dense scotomas did not change in AREDS 2 (p = 0.3), but significantly increased in the AREDS 3 group (p = 0.035). Points with decreased RS were located in all but the central point (p < 0.0001 for all), without significant differences in number among rings. In the AREDS 2 group, fixation stability remained unchanged. In the AREDS 3 group, four eyes deteriorated from stable to unstable fixation at FU (p = 0.045). A significant deterioration in RS is reported in early and intermediate AMD eyes, whereas fixation stability changed only in intermediate AMD (AREDS 3) over long-term follow-up. Microperimetry examination can become a new functional biomarker in early and intermediate AMD patients.

To describe the incidence and patterns of bacterial resistance in urine samples from a tertiary care oncology hospital in Mexico, from 2004 to 2013. We included the strains obtained from urine cultures, describing separately multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. We analyzed the susceptibility to different antibiotics. 51 202 urine cultures were processed during the study; 14 480 (28.3%) cultures were positive. In 11 427 samples Gram negative (79%) were isolated, 2 080 Gram positive (14.4%), and 973 yeasts (6.6%). Escherichia coli was the most frequent bacteria identified (56.1%); 24% of the community strains and 65.7% of the nosocomial were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers (ESBL). Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in 705 samples (4.8%); 115 were ESBL (16%), 13.1% from community and 29.8% from nosocomial source. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 593 cultures (4.1%): 9% from community and 51% nosocomial. MDR bacteria were more frequent in nosocomial isolates. It should be a priority to intensify the rational use of antimicrobials in the community and antibiotic stewardship in the hospital.
27585182	no cancer	-1	0	Ambulatory activity classification with dendogram-based support vector machine: Application in lower-limb active exoskeleton. Ambulatory activity classification is an active area of research for controlling and monitoring state initiation, termination, and transition in mobility assistive devices such as lower-limb exoskeletons. State transition of lower-limb exoskeletons reported thus far are achieved mostly through the use of manual switches or state machine-based logic. In this paper, we propose a postural activity classifier using a 'dendogram-based support vector machine' (DSVM) which can be used to control a lower-limb exoskeleton. A pressure sensor-based wearable insole and two six-axis inertial measurement units (IMU) have been used for recognising two static and seven dynamic postural activities: sit, stand, and sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, level walk, fast walk, slope walk, stair ascent and stair descent. Most of the ambulatory activities are periodic in nature and have unique patterns of response. The proposed classification algorithm involves the recognition of activity patterns on the basis of the periodic shape of trajectories. Polynomial coefficients extracted from the hip angle trajectory and the centre-of-pressure (CoP) trajectory during an activity cycle are used as features to classify dynamic activities. The novelty of this paper lies in finding suitable instrumentation, developing post-processing techniques, and selecting shape-based features for ambulatory activity classification. The proposed activity classifier is used to identify the activity states of a lower-limb exoskeleton. The DSVM classifier algorithm achieved an overall classification accuracy of 95.2%.
27592609	no cancer	-1	0	Magnetic metal-organic framework-titanium dioxide nanocomposite as adsorbent in the magnetic solid-phase extraction of fungicides from environmental water samples. In this work, a core-shell Fe3O4@SiO2@MOF/TiO2 nanocomposite was synthesized and used to as adsorbent for magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) of triazole fungicides from environmental water samples. Five triazole fungicides, namely, triadimenol, hexaconazole, diniconazole, myclobutanil, and tebuconazole, were selected as target analytes for MSPE. These analytes were quantitatively adsorbed on microspheres, and the sorbents were separated from the solution by using a magnet. The analytes were desorbed by methanol and determined through liquid-chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The extraction parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized through response surface methodology. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for the selected fungicides were 0.19-1.20ngL(-1) and 0.61-3.62ngL(-1), respectively. The proposed method was applied to determine the concentration of fungicides in actual environmental water samples. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by measuring the recovery of the spiked samples. The satisfying recoveries of the four water samples ranged from 90.2% to 104.2%. Therefore, the magnetic metal-organic framework/TiO2 nanocomposite based MSPE is a potential approach to analyze fungicides in actual water samples.
27580348	no cancer	-1	0	Effects of environment, dietary regime and ageing on the dengue vector microbiota: evidence of a core microbiota throughout Aedes aegypti lifespan. Mosquito midgut microbiota is a key component of vector competence, as gut bacteria can disturb pathogen development. In this study, we addressed the microbiota composition of Aedes aegypti during its lifespan, under field conditions. We also investigated the possible effects of environment, dietary regime and ageing on the gut community composition. We employed culture independent and dependent approaches to characterise vector microbiota. There was evidence of a lifelong stable core microbiota after mosquitoes were released into an urban settlement, where they presumably fed on a range of vertebrate hosts and carbohydrate sources. This core was formed mainly of bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas and Stenotrophomonas and to the families Oxalobacteraceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae. We showed that both dietary regime and age were associated with the abundance of some bacterial groups in the Ae. aegypti microbiota. The majority of the bacterial groups we identified have been detected in the midgut of Ae. aegypti from laboratory and wild populations, indicating a possible core microbiota associated with this mosquito species. Our findings suggest that Ae. aegypti harbours a stable bacterial community during its adult life, similar to mosquito populations from distinct geographic areas, which may be further explored for arbovirus biocontrol strategies.
27577423	no cancer	-1	0	Analysis of Existing Guidelines for the Systematic Planning Process of Clinical Registries. Clinical registries are a powerful method to observe the clinical practice and natural disease history. In contrast to clinical trials, where guidelines and standardized methods exist and are mandatory, only a few initiatives have published methodological guidelines for clinical registries. The objective of this paper was to review these guidelines and systematically assess their completeness, usability and feasibility according to a SWOT analysis. The results show that each guideline has its own strengths and weaknesses. While one supports the systematic planning process, the other discusses clinical registries in great detail. However, the feasibility was mostly limited and the special requirements of clinical registries, their flexible, expandable and adaptable technological structure was not addressed consistently.

27600912	no cancer	-1	0	Is there significance in identification of non-predominant micropapillary or solid components in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma? A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was 'in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas, does the presence of non-predominant micropapillary (MIP) or solid (SOL) growth component influence long-term survival and surgical strategy?'. Altogether, more than 600 papers were found using the reported search, of which 13 presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers were tabulated. The data collected showed that non-predominant MIP or SOL components in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma can be up to 60.4 and 41.8%, respectively. MIP or SOL components were associated with significantly reduced period of disease-free or overall survival. One study also showed a higher incidence of occult lymph node metastasis in patients with a minor MIP component. Furthermore, the presence of an MIP/SOL component in early-stage adenocarcinomas (ADCs) could influence the oncological outcome following sublobar resection. We conclude that a non-predominant MIP/SOL pattern is a negative prognostic factor and an indicator of early recurrence after limited resection.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ex-PRESS (R50) implantation combined with phacoemulsification in primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) patients with cataract.Twenty-four eyes of 24 patients with unregulated PACG underwent combined cataract and glaucoma surgery. After phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, the Ex-PRESS (R-50) was inserted into the anterior chamber under a scleral flap. The intraocular pressure (IOP), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), number of medications, and complications were recorded preoperatively as well as postoperatively on day 7 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.The mean follow-up was 16.4 ± 2.5 months (range 14-21 months) and the mean age of the patients was 64.7 ± 6.8 years (range 56-78 years). The mean IOP was 20.4 ± 5.4 mm Hg preoperatively and decreased to 10.2 ± 2.8, 13.1 ± 2.7, 14.9 ± 4.1, 14.3 ± 3.9, and 14.0 ± 3.6 mm Hg on day 7 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery (all P < 0.005). At 12 months, the mean BCVA was 0.62 ± 0.33 and the number of medications was 0.3 ± 0.6. Most of complications were resolved spontaneously and conservatively.The Ex-PRESS implantation combined with phacoemulsification cataract extraction is safe and effective for reducing IOP and antiglaucoma medications in PACG patients with cataract.
27583254	no cancer	-1	0	Will targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling work in hematopoietic malignancies? The constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be critical in clinical cancer patients as well as in laboratory cancer models including hematological malignancies. Great efforts have been made to develop inhibitors targeting this pathway in hematological malignancies but so far the efficacies of these inhibitors were not as good as expected. By analyzing existing literatures and datasets available, we found that mutations of genes in the pathway only constitute a very small subset of hematological malignancies. Deep understanding of the function of gene, the pathway and/or its regulators, and the cellular response to inhibitors, may help us design better drugs targeting the hematological malignancies.
27577739	no cancer	-1	0	Soluble Neuregulin-1 from Microglia Enhances Amyloid Beta-induced Neuronal Death. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (erbB), and its interaction involves activation of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which increases the expression of the β2 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor and subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In the dentate gyrus of 14-month-old Tg2576 mice, NRG-1 was strongly expressed compared with age-matched controls. The supernatant of oligomeric amyloid β peptide (Aβ42)-treated glial cells enhanced the Aβ42-induced cytotoxic effects, but the expression of Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in microglial cells was not changed upon cytotoxic treatment. This suggests that the oligomeric form of Aβ42 toxicity is not related to apoptosis, which is mediated by cell-to-cell interaction. During the 24-h incubation, the secretion of the soluble form of NRG-1 was increased, but interleukin 6 secretion was not changed. Further, soluble NRG-1 increased Aβ42-induced toxicity. In conclusion, soluble NRG-1 significantly enhanced oligomeric Aβ42-induced toxicity through the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress by the increase of a phospho-translation initiation factor 2 alpha (p-eIF2α).
17131328	endocrine gland cancer	170	1	Involvement of ribonucleotide reductase M1 subunit overexpression in gemcitabine resistance of human pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal of all solid tumors partially because of its chemoresistance. Although gemcitabine is widely used as a first selected agent for the treatment of this disease despite low response rate, molecular mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer still remain obscure. The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance. The 81-fold gemcitabine resistant variant MiaPaCa2-RG was selected from pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2. By microarray analysis between MiaPaCa2 and MiaPaCa2-RG, 43 genes (0.04%) were altered expression of more than 2-fold. The most upregulated gene in MiaPaCa2-RG was ribonucleotide reductase M1 subunit (RRM1) with 4.5-fold up-regulation. Transfection with RRM1-specific RNAi suppressed more than 90% of RRM1 mRNA and protein expression. After RRM1-specific RNAi transfection, gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG was reduced to the same level of MiaPaCa2. The 18 recurrent pancreatic cancer patients treated by gemcitabine were divided into 2 groups by RRM1 levels. There was a significant association between gemcitabine response and RRM1 expression (p = 0.018). Patients with high RRM1 levels had poor survival after gemcitabine treatment than those with low RRM1 levels (p = 0.016). RRM1 should be a key molecule in gemcitabine resistance in human pancreatic cancer through both in vitro and clinical models. RRM1 may have the potential as predictor and modulator of gemcitabine treatment.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health burden accounting for around 170 million chronic infections worldwide. Since its discovery, which dates back to about 30 years ago, many details of the viral genome organization and the astonishing genetic diversity have been unveiled but, owing to the difficulty of culturing HCV in vitro and obtaining fully susceptible yet immunocompetent in vivo models, we are still a long way from the full comprehension of viral life cycle, host cell pathways facilitating or counteracting infection, pathogenetic mechanisms in vivo, and host defenses. Here, we illustrate the viral life cycle into cells, describe the interplay between immune and genetic host factors shaping the course of infection, and provide details of the molecular approaches currently used to genotype, monitor replication in vivo, and studying the emergence of drug-resistant viral variants.
27582743	no cancer	-1	0	Genome-Wide Analysis of MicroRNA Responses to the Phytohormone Abscisic Acid in Populus euphratica. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a type of non-coding small RNA with a regulatory function at the posttranscriptional level in plant growth development and in response to abiotic stress. Previous studies have not reported on miRNAs responses to the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) at a genome-wide level in Populus euphratica, a model tree for studying abiotic stress responses in woody plants. Here we analyzed the miRNA response to ABA at a genome-wide level in P. euphratica utilizing high-throughput sequencing. To systematically perform a genome-wide analysis of ABA-responsive miRNAs in P. euphratica, nine sRNA libraries derived from three groups (control, treated with ABA for 1 day and treated with ABA for 4 days) were constructed. Each group included three libraries from three individual plantlets as biological replicate. In total, 151 unique mature sequences belonging to 75 conserved miRNA families were identified, and 94 unique sequences were determined to be novel miRNAs, including 56 miRNAs with miRNA(*) sequences. In all, 31 conserved miRNAs and 31 novel miRNAs response to ABA significantly differed among the groups. In addition, 4132 target genes were predicted for the conserved and novel miRNAs. Confirmed by real-time qPCR, expression changes of miRNAs were inversely correlated with the expression profiles of their putative targets. The Populus special or novel miRNA-target interactions were predicted might be involved in some biological process related stress tolerance. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of how P. euphratica miRNA respond to ABA, and moreover, different temporal dynamics were observed in different ABA-treated libraries.
16404430	thoracic cancer	5093	1	PTEN activity could be a predictive marker of trastuzumab efficacy in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Trastuzumab is the only HER2/neu-directed therapy to have received Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The efficacy of trastuzumab depends on the HER2/neu status of the tumour and the patient's prior treatment, but even when patients are selected on the basis of HER2/neu gene amplification, the single-agent response rate ranges from 12 to 30% and few patients respond to trastuzumab monotherapy. Here, we propose PTEN as a predictive biomarker for trastuzumab efficacy. Human breast cancer SKBR3 and drug-resistant SKBR3/R cells were investigated. We also examined clinical samples from patients who had been treated with trastuzumab and analysed the relationship between trastuzumab efficacy and PTEN level. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway was observed to be highly active in the drug-resistant cells, and their level of PTEN was low. Delivery of antisense PTEN duplex siRNA significantly decreased the trastuzumab chemosensitivity of parental SKBR3 cells, and marked activation of Akt signalling pathway was also recognised. Moreover, immunohistochemical investigation revealed that trastuzumab treatment was remarkably successful in cells with elevated PTEN expression. Along with the immune-system-associated cytotoxic mechanism, several mechanisms have been proposed for the effect of trastuzumab. PTEN activity might play an important and major role in its HER2/PI3K/Akt-mediated antitumour effect, and could be a useful biomarker for predicting the efficacy of trastuzumab in the treatment of breast cancer.

We theoretically investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls driven by spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnet-heavy-metal bilayers. We show that spin-orbit torques drive antiferromagnetic domain walls much faster than ferromagnetic domain walls. As the domain wall velocity approaches the maximum spin-wave group velocity, the domain wall undergoes Lorentz contraction and emits spin waves in the terahertz frequency range. The interplay between spin-orbit torques and the relativistic dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls leads to the efficient manipulation of antiferromagnetic spin textures and paves the way for the generation of high frequency signals from antiferromagnets.
27580735	no cancer	-1	0	What MRI Findings Predict Failure 10 Years After Surgery for Femoroacetabular Impingement? Magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) with radial cuts is presently the best available preoperative imaging study to evaluate chondrolabral lesions in the setting of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Existing followup studies for surgical treatment of FAI have evaluated predictors of treatment failure based on preoperative clinical examination, intraoperative findings, and conventional radiography. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined whether any preoperative findings on MRA images might be associated with failure of surgical treatment of FAI in the long term. The purposes of this study were (1) to identify the preoperative MRA findings that are associated with conversion to THA, any progression of osteoarthritis, and/or a Harris hip score of < 80 points after acetabuloplasty and/or osteochondroplasty of the femoral head-neck junction through a surgical hip dislocation (SHD) for FAI at a minimum 10-year followup; and (2) identify the age of patients with symptomatic FAI when these secondary degenerative findings were detected on preoperative radial MRAs. We retrospectively studied 121 patients (146 hips) who underwent acetabuloplasty and/or osteochondroplasty of the femoral head-neck junction through SHD for symptomatic anterior FAI between July 2001 and March 2003. We excluded 35 patients (37 hips) with secondary FAI after previous surgery and 11 patients (12 hips) with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. All patients underwent preoperative MRA to further specify chondrolabral lesions except in 19 patients (32 hips) including 17 patients (20 hips) who presented with an MRI from an external institution taken with a different protocol, 10 patients with no preoperative MRA because the patients had already been operated on the contralateral side with a similar appearance, and two patients (two hips) refused MRA because of claustrophobia. This resulted in 56 patients (65 hips) with idiopathic FAI and a preoperative MRA. Of those, three patients (three hips) did not have minimal 10-year followup (one patient died; two hips with followup between 5 and 6 years). The remaining patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically at a mean followup of 11 years (range, 10-13 years). Thirteen pathologic radiographic findings on the preoperative MRA were evaluated for an association with the following endpoints using Cox regression analysis: conversion to THA, radiographic evidence of any progression of osteoarthritis, and/or a Harris hip score of < 80. The age of the patient when each degenerative pattern was found on the preoperative MRA was recorded. The following MRI findings were associated with one or more of our predefined failure endpoints: cartilage damage exceeding 60° of the circumference had a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-5.6; p = 0.003) compared with a damage of less than 60°, presence of an acetabular rim cyst had a HR of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.1-5.2; p = 0.008) compared with hips without these cysts, and presence of a sabertooth osteophyte had a HR of 3.2 (95% CI, 2.3-4.2; p = 0.013) compared with hips without a sabertooth osteophyte. The degenerative pattern associated with the youngest patient age when detected on preoperative MRA was the sabertooth osteophyte (lower quartile 27 years) followed by cartilage damage exceeding 60° of the circumference (28 years) and the presence of an acetabular rim bone cyst (31 years). Preoperative MRAs with radial cuts reveal important findings that may be associated with future failure of surgical treatment for FAI. Most of these factors are not visible on conventional radiographs or standard hip MRIs. Preoperative MRA evaluation is therefore strongly recommended on a routine basis for patients undergoing these procedures. Findings associated with conversion to arthroplasty, radiographic evidence of any progression of osteoarthritis, and/or a Harris hip score of < 80 points should be incorporated into the decision-making process in patients being evaluated for joint-preserving hip surgery. Level III, therapeutic study.
27589552	no cancer	-1	0	Maternal variables associated with physiologic stress and perinatal complications in preterm infants. Complications of prematurity may be related to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in preterm infants. Increased intrauterine exposure to cortisol may be responsible for adverse prenatal programming and subsequent dysfunction of the infant's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The aim of the study was to describe maternal social variables and their association with infant cortisol levels and complications of prematurity. Preterm infants <32 weeks' gestation were recruited. Primary outcomes were development of complications of prematurity and physiologic stress response, represented by cord blood and salivary cortisol levels on first day of life. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses were performed. Fifteen of 31 infants enrolled developed a complication of prematurity. Infants of greater gestational age when prenatal care was established had lower cord blood cortisol (p = 0.009) and trended a higher risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (p = 0.069). Infants whose mothers smoked more showed significantly different salivary cortisol distributions on day 1 (p = 0.037), and were at greater risk for intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.018). The association between maternal social variables, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and complications of prematurity supports the research model of physiologic dysregulation/allostatic load as a mechanism for complications in preterm infants. More research is warranted to investigate associations between maternal social variables, maternal stress levels, and adverse prenatal programming of the infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
27581581	no cancer	-1	0	Severity of Household Food Insecurity Is Positively Associated with Mental Disorders among Children and Adolescents in the United States. Household food insecurity and mental disorders are both prevalent conditions among children and adolescents (i.e., youth) in the United States. Although some research has examined the association between the 2 conditions, it is not known whether more severe food insecurity is differently associated with mental disorders in youth. We investigated the association between severity of household food insecurity and mental disorders among children (aged 4-11 y) and adolescents (aged 12-17 y) using valid and reliable measures of both household food security status and mental disorders. We analyzed cross-sectional data on 16,918 children and 14,143 adolescents whose families participated in the 2011-2014 National Health Interview Survey. The brief Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the 10-item USDA Household Food Security Survey Module were used to measure mental disorders and food security status, respectively. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to test the association between household food security status and mental disorders in youth. There was a significant linear trend in ORs, such that as severity of household food insecurity increased so did the odds of youth having a mental disorder (P < 0.001). Other selected results included the following: compared with food-secure households, youth in marginally food-secure households had higher odds of having a mental disorder with impairment [child OR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.52); adolescent OR: 1.33 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.68)]. In addition, compared with food-secure households, youth in very-low-food-secure households had higher odds of having a mental disorder with severe impairment [child OR: 2.55 (95% CI: 1.90, 3.43); adolescent OR: 3.44 (95% CI: 2.50, 4.75)]. The severity of household food insecurity is positively associated with mental disorders among both children and adolescents in the United States. These results suggest that improving household food security status has the potential to reduce mental disorders among US youth.
27601592	no cancer	-1	0	High risk premenopausal Luminal A breast cancer patients derive no benefit from adjuvant cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy: results from the DBCG77B clinical trial. Luminal A breast cancers have better prognosis than other molecular subtypes. Luminal A cancers may also be insensitive to adjuvant chemotherapy, although there is little high level evidence to confirm this concept. The primary hypothesis in this formal prospective-retrospective analysis was to assess interaction between subtype (Luminal A vs. other) and treatment (chemotherapy vs. not) for the primary endpoint (10-year invasive disease free survival) of a breast cancer trial randomizing women to adjuvant chemotherapy, analyzed in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models using the Wald interaction test. The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 77B clinical trial randomized 1072 premenopausal women to no systematic treatment (control), levamisole, cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil arms. All arms included radiotherapy but no endocrine therapy. Researchers with no access to clinical data performed intrinsic subtype analysis on tissue microarrays using published immunohistochemical methods based on estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, Ki67 and basal markers. 709 patients had tissue available; chemotherapy benefit in these patients was similar to the original trial (hazard ratio (HR) 0.56). Immunohistochemistry classified 165 as Luminal A, 319 Luminal B, 58 HER2-enriched and 82 core basal (among 91 triple negative). Patients with Luminal A breast tumors did not benefit from chemotherapy (HR 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.53-2.14, p = 0.86), whereas patients with non-luminal A subtypes did (HR 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.66, p < 0.001); p (interaction) = 0.048. In a prospective-retrospective analysis of a randomized trial, patients with Luminal A breast cancers did not benefit from adjuvant cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy.
27578344	no cancer	-1	0	Should violence services be integrated within abortion care? A UK situation analysis. The prevalence of violence against women worldwide raises the question of the desirability and feasibility of integrating interpersonal violence (IPV) services within abortion care. By examining present services and context in an Inner London borough in the UK, this situation analysis explored the hypothesis that an established, integrated, health-based service (comprising raised awareness, staff training in routine IPV enquiry and referral to a community-based in-reach IPV service) would be transferable into abortion services. Four sources of qualitative data investigated views on integrating services: key stakeholder in-depth interviews including with providers of abortion and IPV services and commissioners and IPV survivors with past abortion service use (3 user, 15 provider); qualitative analysis of the open-ended part of a survey of current abortion service users with and without experience of IPV; feedback from an interactive workshop and data from field observations. While there was consensus among all informants that women experiencing IPV and seeking abortion have unidentified, unaddressed needs, how any intervention might be organised to address these needs was contested; thus questions remain about whether, when and how to raise the topic of IPV and what to offer. Two major anxieties surfaced: a practical concern in terms of interrupting a streamlined abortion service that suits the majority of staff and patients, and a conceptual concern about risk of stigmatising abortion seekers as 'victims in crisis'. Thus, our findings indicate: when integrating IPV interventions into abortion services, local context, the integrity of separate pathways, and women's safety and agency must be considered, especially when abortion rights are under attack. Novel approaches are required and should be researched.

27601815	no cancer	-1	0	Survivin expression in oral lichen planus: Role in malignant transformation. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a potentially malignant disease with a prevalence rate of 0.5-2.2%. It is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, in which cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells trigger apoptosis of the basal cells of oral epithelium. The reported progression of OLP to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ranges from 0.4% to 6.5%. Apoptosis plays a major role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. The evasion of apoptosis in the form of dysregulation of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) may lead to malignant transformation. Survivin belongs to the second gene family of IAPs, which is overexpressed in many tumors such as OSCC and gastric carcinomas, and its expression is widely involved in apoptosis as well as in tumor metastasis. Sections were obtained from the paraffin-embedded archival blocks of patients diagnosed histologically as OLP, and cases with normal epithelium were used for comparison whereas cases with OSCC were used as positive control. We analyzed the expression of survivin in OLP and normal epithelium. Survivin expression with moderate intensity was seen in the cells of basal layer with nuclear positivity in cases of OLP, whereas mild to nil expression was seen in normal epithelium with nuclear and cytoplasmic positivity in different layers. Survivin positivity was seen predominantly in the basal cells of OLP suggesting increased longevity of these cells which in turn might acquire dysplastic changes leading to increased risk of malignant transformation of this premalignant condition. Although the conversion rate may be low, the potential exists in the indolent course of the disease.
27584945	no cancer	-1	0	Genetic Ancestry using Mitochondrial DNA in patients with Triple-negative breast cancer (GAMiT study). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu receptors, and is aggressive and therapeutically challenging. Genetic ancestry testing is an emerging medical field. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is distinct from nuclear DNA, is maternally inherited and allows for origin determination. Patients with TNBC tend to be younger and are more likely to be African American, making this an ideal disease for mtDNA exploration. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to perform mtDNA for self-described African American, White, and Hispanic patients with TNBC to identify mtDNA patterns. Patients with TNBC who were at any stage of therapy/survivorship were included. Self-reported ethnicity was confirmed at the time of the prospective buccal swab. Haplogroup prediction was performed on sequencing of hypervariable region 1. Using sequence similarity scores and lineage databases, sequence patterns were determined. Data regarding presentation and treatment, tumor features, and outcomes was collected. A total of 92 patients were included: 31 self-described African American, 31 White, and 30 Hispanic individuals. Hispanic patients were found to have the largest tumor size (4.5 cm; P = .01) and youngest age (41 years; P<.0001). Eight patients were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. There were no differences noted among groups with regard to surgery, lymph node metastases, or survival. Analysis revealed Nigerian, Cameroon, or Sierra Leone ancestry and haplogroups A, U, H, or B to be the most common mtDNA patterns. Twelve discordances (13%) between mtDNA analysis and self-described ethnicity were identified among the 92 patients. The highest discordance (26%; 8 patients) was noted in self-described Hispanic patients: 3 had Nigerian ancestry, and 1 individual demonstrated haplogroup K mtDNA (Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry). Discordance between self-reported ethnicity and mtDNA analysis was identified in 13% of patients with TNBC. The identification of mtDNA patterns with a predisposition toward TNBC may allow for risk stratification. Cancer 2016. © 2016 American Cancer Society.

The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and potential drawbacks of near-infrared (NIR) endoscopy with indocyanine green (ICG) to examine mucosal head and neck lesions. NIR ICG endoscopy was applied to image head and neck cancer epithelium in vivo. The evaluation of the ICG videos was performed off-line independently by 2 evaluators and blinded with respect to final histopathological results from biopsies taken as the gold standard. Forty percent of the lesions from 55 patients were histologically malignant. ICG positivity showed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to be related to a malignant tumor of 90.5%, 90.9%, and 89.1%, respectively. The kappa index for the interobserver assessment showed a 94.4% agreement for the assessment of the ICG positivity. Side effects of the NIR ICG endoscopy did not arise. NIR ICG endoscopy in patients with mucosal head and neck lesions was feasible and safe. It might help intraoperatively to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. © 2016 The Authors Head & Neck Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016.

Despite the presence of several diagnosis scales for delirium, no prediction scale that is specific for postoperative delirium after abdominal surgery is available. We sought to create a novel delirium prediction system that is specific for abdominal surgery. This study included 213 consecutive patients who required management in the surgical ICU following abdominal surgery. The Neelon and Champagne (NEECHAM) Confusion score was monitored throughout the postoperative course and patients with low NEECHAM score (≤26) were diagnosed as having delirium. Seventy-three patients (34%) were categorized in the delirium group. Multivariate analyses indicated that an age >70 years, hypertension, those undergoing hepatopancreatobiliary or upper gastrointestinal surgeries, a serum albumin level <2.5 g/dl on postoperative day (POD) 3 or 5 and a ≥6 mEq/l gap in the serum sodium level between the preoperative value and that on POD 3 were independently associated with a low NEECHAM score (≤26). When the presence of each risk was counted as 1 point, 21 patients had ≥4 points and 15 of them (71%) had low NEECHAM score. The scoring system combining multiple risk factors may be useful for predicting patients with an elevated risk for postoperative delirium after abdominal surgery.
27596805	no cancer	-1	0	Time efficiency, difficulty, and operator's preference comparing digital and conventional implant impressions: a randomized controlled trial. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to analyze implant impression techniques applying intraoral scanning (IOS) and the conventional method according to time efficiency, difficulty, and operator's preference. One hundred participants (n = 100) with diverse levels of dental experience were included and randomly assigned to Group A performing digital scanning (TRIOS Pod) first or Group B conducting conventional impression (open tray with elastomer) first, while the second method was performed consecutively. A customized maxillary model with a bone-level-type implant in the right canine position (FDI-position 13) was mounted on a phantom training unit realizing a standardized situation for all participants. Outcome parameter was time efficiency, and potential influence of clinical experience, operator's perception of level of difficulty, applicability of each method, and subjective preferences were analyzed with Wilcoxon -Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Mean total work time varied between 5.01 ± 1.56 min (students) and 4.53 ± 1.34 min (dentists) for IOS, and between 12.03 ± 2.00 min (students) and 10.09 ± 1.15 min (dentists) for conventional impressions with significant differences between the two methods. Neither assignment to Group A or B, nor gender nor number of impression-taking procedures did influence working time. Difficulty and applicability of IOS was perceived more favorable compared to conventional impressions, and effectiveness of IOS was rated better by the majority of students (88%) and dentists (64%). While 76% of the students preferred IOS, 48% of the dentists were favoring conventional impressions, and 26% each IOS and either technique. For single-implant sites, the quadrant-like intraoral scanning (IOS) was more time efficient than the conventional full-arch impression technique in a phantom head simulating standardized optimal conditions. A high level of acceptance for IOS was observed among students and dentists.
27577460	no cancer	-1	0	The Precise Observation System for the Safe Use of Medicines (POSSUM): An Approach for Studying Medication Administration Errors in the Field. Medication administration errors (MAEs) in hospital are frequent and significantly more likely to result in serious harm to patients than other medication error types. Many interventions have been proposed in order reduce MAEs and the amount of harm associated with these errors. A major limitation in assessing the effectiveness of these interventions has been the lack of robust measures for assessing changes in MAEs and associated harms. Drawing upon extensive foundational research we have developed a robust approach and data collection software to be applied in direct observational studies of nurses to allow measurement of changes in MAE rates. We report how this approach is being applied in a large stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an electronic medication management system to reduce MAEs in a paediatric hospital.
27602237	no cancer	-1	0	"Infertility in men with inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects young adults. Fertility-related issues are therefore important in the management of patients with IBD. However, relatively modest attention has been paid to reproductive issues faced by men with IBD. To investigate the effects of IBD and its treatment on male fertility, we reviewed the current literature using a systematic search for published studies. A PubMed search were performed using the main search terms ""IBD AND male infertility"", ""Crohn's disease AND male infertility"", ""ulcerative colitis AND male infertility"". References in review articles were used if relevant. We noted that active inflammation, poor nutrition, alcohol use, smoking, medications, and surgery may cause infertility in men with IBD. In surgery such as proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, rectal incision seems to be associated with sexual dysfunction. Of the medications used for IBD, sulfasalazine reversibly reduces male fertility. No other medications appear to affect male fertility significantly, although small studies suggested some adverse effects. There are limited data on the effects of drugs for IBD on male fertility and pregnancy outcomes; however, patients should be informed of the possible effects of paternal drug exposure. This review provides information on fertility-related issues in men with IBD and discusses treatment options."
22215752	respiratory system cancer	50615	1	Pretreatment epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation predicts shorter EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor response duration in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations have excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but T790M mutation accounts for most TKI drug resistance. This study used highly sensitive methods to detect T790M before and after TKI therapy and investigated the association of T790M and its mutation frequencies with clinical outcome. Direct sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to assess T790M in the following two cohorts of patients with NSCLC: TKI-naive patients (n = 107) and TKI-treated patients (n = 85). Results were correlated with TKI treatment response and survival. MALDI-TOF MS was highly sensitive in detecting and quantifying the frequency of EGFR-activating mutations and T790M (detection limits, 0.4% to 2.2%). MALDI-TOF MS identified more T790M than direct sequencing in TKI-naive patients with NSCLC (27 of 107 patients, 25.2% v three of 107 patients, 2.8%, respectively; P < .001) and in TKI-treated patients (before TKI: 23 of 73 patients, 31.5% v two of 73 patients, 2.7%, respectively; P < .001; and after TKI: 10 of 12 patients, 83.3% v four of 12 patients, 33.3%, respectively; P = .0143). The EGFR mutations and their frequencies were confirmed by NGS. T790M was an independent predictor of decreased progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with NSCLC who received TKI treatment (P < .05, multivariate Cox regression). T790M may not be a rare event before or after TKI therapy in patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. The pretreatment T790M mutation was associated with shorter PFS with EGFR TKI therapy in patients with NSCLC.
27590428	no cancer	-1	0	Enhancement of innate immunity with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor did not mitigate disease in pigs infected with a highly pathogenic Chinese PRRSV strain. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is responsible for one of the most economically important diseases in swine worldwide. It causes reproductive failure in sows and pneumonia in pigs that predisposes them to secondary bacterial infections. Methods to control PRRSV and/or limit secondary bacterial infections are desired to reduce the impact of this virus on animal health. Neutrophils play a major role in combatting infection; they can act as phagocytes as well as produce and release lytic enzymes that have potent antimicrobial effects leading to the destruction and clearance of bacterial pathogens. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a cytokine that controls the production, differentiation and function of granulocytes (including neutrophils) from the bone marrow. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that encoding porcine G-CSF in a replication-defective adenovirus (Ad5-G-CSF) and delivering a single dose to pigs induced a neutrophilia lasting more than two weeks. As secondary bacterial infection is a common occurrence following PRRSV infection, particularly following challenge with highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a single prophylactic dose of adenovirus-encoded G-CSF to mitigate secondary bacterial disease associated with HP-PRRSV infection. Administration of Ad5-G-CSF induced a significant neutrophilia as expected. However, between 1 and 2days following HP-PRRSV challenge the number of circulating neutrophils decreased dramatically in the HP-PRRSV infected group, but not the non-infected Ad5-G-CSF group. Ad5-G-CSF administration induced monocytosis as well, which was also reduced by HP-PRRSV challenge. There was no difference in the progression of disease between the Ad5-G-CSF and Ad5-empty groups following HP-PRRSV challenge, with pneumonia and systemic bacterial infection occurring in both treatment groups. Given the impact of HP-PRRSV infection on the neutrophilia induced by the Ad5-G-CSF administration, additional studies are warranted to evaluate the timing of Ad5-G-CSF induced neutrophilia and multiple G-CSF inoculations on protection against secondary bacterial infection following PRRSV infection. Nevertheless, this study may provide insight into the pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV.
27590560	no cancer	-1	0	Application of predictive models to assess the influence of thyme essential oil on Salmonella Enteritidis behaviour during shelf life of ready-to-eat turkey products. Consumers' demand for ready-to-eat (RTE) turkey meat is attributed to its convenience and healthy properties. However, as cooked meat product it is subjected to post-process contamination, thus allowing presence and growth of microbial pathogens, such as Salmonella spp.. The aim of this study was to include a natural antimicrobial, thyme essential oil (TEO), on RTE turkey products in order to evaluate its effectiveness throughout the shelf life. To do so, the effect of four different formulations of cooked RTE turkey products on Salmonella Enteritidis behaviour was investigated. Products' slices were surface inoculated with S. Enteritidis (ca. 4 to 5logcfu/g), subsequently stored at 10 and 25°C and microbiologically analysed during 18 and 12days, respectively. Predictive microbiology models fitted to count data were used to evaluate microbial behaviour. Results showed that S. Enteritidis behaviour on RTE turkey products slices during storage was strongly dependent on temperature. The pathogen was able to grow on slices at all tested conditions during storage at 25°C and no statistical differences were detected (p>0.05) between growth parameters. At 10°C, different behaviour patterns were observed. The application of TEO led to higher Salmonella inactivation rates on a product exempt of chemical preservatives. The addition of this novel antimicrobial on meat products or its incorporation on meat active packaging systems as a part of hurdle technology could increase RTE turkey products safety while satisfying the demand of more natural foods.

Lead extraction using laser sheaths is performed mainly for cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. However, there are few reports concerning the management of CIED infections in Japan. Lead extraction procedures were performed in 183 patients targeting 450 leads (atrial leads: 170, ventricular: 181, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs): 79, and coronary sinus: 20). One hundred twenty patients (65.6%) presented with pocket infections without the presentation of an endovascular infection. Blood cultures were positive at least once in 63 patients (34.4%). Complete procedure success was achieved for 437 leads (97.1%) while partial removal occurred in nine, and failure in four leads. Major complications directly related to the procedure occurred in five patients (2.7%). Two of the four patients with a cardiac tamponade required a surgical repair. All patients received intravenous antibiotics, at least, one week after the procedure. Pocket or systemic infections were successfully controlled in 181 patients (98.9%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (30.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (37.1%) were the most common causes of CIED infections. The current status of CIED infections in Japan seems to be similar to that previously reported from foreign countries. The optimal treatment of CIED infections involves the complete explantation of all hardware, followed by antibiotic therapy.
27600625	no cancer	-1	0	Promising novel therapeutic approaches in the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Primary and secondary resistance to currently available licensed tyrosine kinase inhibitors poses a real clinical challenge in the management of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Within the frame of early phase clinical trials novel systemic treatments are currently being evaluated to target both the well explored and novel emerging downstream effectors of KIT and PDGFRA signaling. Alternative therapeutic approaches also include exploring novel inhibitors of the KIT/PDGFRA receptors, immune checkpoint and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The final clinical trial outcome data for these agents are highly anticipated. Integration of new diagnostic techniques into routine clinical practice can potentially guide tailored delivery of agents in the treatment of a highly polyclonal, heterogeneous disease such as heavily pretreated advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
27588343	no cancer	-1	0	Impact of Acute Psychological Stress on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Face of Insulin Resistance. Individuals with insulin resistance (IR) are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Psychological stress may contribute to develop CVD in IR although mechanisms are poorly understood. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that individuals with IR have enhanced emotional and physiological responses to acute psychological stress, leading to increased CVD risk. Sixty participants were enrolled into the study, and classified into IR group (n = 31) and insulin sensitive group (n = 29) according to the Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, which was calculated based on an oral glucose tolerance test. The Trier social stress test, a standardized experimental stress paradigm, was performed on each participant, and emotional and physiological responses were examined. Blood was collected from each subject for insulin, cytokines and cortisol measurements. Compared with insulin sensitive group, individuals with IR had significantly lower ratings of energy and calm, but higher fatigue levels in response to acute stressors. Individuals with IR also showed blunted heart rate reactivity following stress. In addition, the IR status was worsened by acute psychological stress as demonstrated by further increased insulin secretion. Furthermore, individuals with IR showed significantly increased levels of leptin and interleukin-6, but decreased levels of adiponectin, at baseline, stress test and post-stress period. Our findings in individuals with IR under acute stress would allow a better understanding of the risks for developing CVD and to tailor the interventions for better outcomes.

We performed a 1-year longitudinal study of Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), and timed function tests in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Skeletal muscle dystrophin was quantified by immunoblot. We grouped deletions ending on exon 45 (""del 45-x"", n = 28) or 51 (""del x-51"", n = 10); isolated exon 48 deletion (""del 48"", n = 10); and other mutations (n = 21). Only patients in the ""del 45-x"" or ""other"" groups became non-ambulatory (n = 5, log-rank p = n.s.) or unable to run (n = 22, p < 0.001). All measures correlated positively with dystrophin quantity and negatively with age, and were significantly more impaired in the ""del 45-x"" and ""other"" groups. After one year, NSAA score decreased significantly (-0.9 ± 1.6, p < 0.001); in the ""del 45-x"" group, both NSAA (-1.3 ± 1.7, p = 0.001) and 6MWT (-12 ± 31 m, p = 0.059) decreased. We conclude that patients with ""del x-51"" or ""del 48"" mutations have mild or asymptomatic BMD, while ""del 45-x"" mutations cause comparatively severe weakness, and functional deterioration in 1 year. Furthermore, exon 51 skipping could be more effective than exon 45 skipping in Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
27585300	no cancer	-1	0	Three Dimensional Clustered Nanostructures for Microfluidic Surface Enhanced Raman Detection. A materials fabrication concept based on a fluid-construction strategy to create three dimensional (3D) ZnO@ZnS-Ag active nanostructures at arbitrary position within confined microchannels to form an integrated microfluidic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) system is presented. The fluid-construction process allowed facile construction of the nanostructured substrates, which were shown to possess a substantial number of integrated hot spots that support SERS activity. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis suggested that the 3D clustered geometry facilitated hot spot formation. High sensitivity and good recycle performance were demonstrated using 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA), and a mixture of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and 4-MBA as target organic pollutants to evaluate the SERS microfluidic device performance. The 3D clustered nanostructures were also effective in the detection of a representative nerve agent and biomolecule. The results of this investigation provide a materials and process approach to the fabrication of requisite nanostructures for the online detection of organic pollutants, devices for real time observation of environmental hazards, and personal-health monitoring.
27579839	no cancer	-1	0	Cochlear Size and Shape Variability and Implications in Cochlear Implantation Surgery. To study variations in cochlear size and shape with potential implications for cochlear implants. A comprehension of the cochlear morphology is essential for nontraumatic electrode insertion and hearing preservation in individual surgery. A total of 310 normal developed cochleae with three-dimensional multiplanar reconstructed computed tomography images were studied. We measured the linear length of the half (1/2TL) and three quarters (3/4TL) of the basal turn, the first turn (1TL), the first two turns (2TL), and the cochlear length. The length and width of the cochlear base as well as the tilt angle within the first turn (α) and the angle between the first and second turns (γ) of the cochlea were also measured. The measurement results showed that cochlear size and shape vary greatly among individuals. The length and width of cochlear base had positive correlations with 1/2TL (r = 0.526 and r = 0.625), 3/4TL (r = 0.633 and r = 0.729), 1TL (r = 0.658 and r = 0.754), 2TL (r = 0.677 and r = 0.795) and cochlear length (r = 0.622 and r = 0.769) respectively. The mean tilt angle α was 9.72 ± 1.85 degrees while the angle γ was 14.90 ± 1.36 degrees, and both had significant positive correlations with the ratio of length to width of cochlear base (p = 0.040 and p = 0.013). The significant variations of the cochlear anatomy suggest that personalized cochlear implant is needed. The width of cochlear base has a stronger association with the linear length of cochlea. And the angle within the first turn and between the first and second turns can be predicted by the ratio of length to width of cochlear base.
27580079	no cancer	-1	0	Type I IFN Signaling Is Dispensable during Secondary Viral Infection. Innate immune responses in general, and type I interferons (T1IFNs) in particular, play an important and often essential role during primary viral infections, by directly combatting the virus and by maximizing the primary adaptive immune response. Several studies have suggested that T1IFNs also contribute very substantially to the secondary (recall) response; they are thought (i) to be required to drive the early attrition of memory T cells, (ii) to support the subsequent expansion of surviving virus-specific memory cells, and (iii) to assist in the suppression and clearance of the infectious agent. However, many of these observations were predicated upon models in which T1IFN signaling was interrupted prior to a primary immune response, raising the possibility that the resulting memory cells might be intrinsically abnormal. We have directly addressed this by using an inducible-Cre model system in which the host remains genetically-intact during the primary response to infection, and in which T1IFN signaling can be effectively ablated prior to secondary viral challenge. We report that, in stark contrast to primary infection, T1IFN signaling is not required during the recall response. IFNαβR-deficient memory CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cells undergo attrition and expansion with kinetics that are indistinguishable from those of receptor-sufficient cells. Moreover, even in the absence of functional T1IFN signaling, the host's immune capacity to rapidly suppress, and then to eradicate, a secondary infection remains intact. Thus, this study shows that T1IFN signaling is dispensable during the recall response to a virus infection. Moreover, two broader implications may be drawn. First, a T cell's requirement for a cytokine is highly dependent on the cell's maturation / differentiation status. Consequently, second, these data underscore the importance of evaluating a gene's impact by modulating its expression or function in a temporally-controllable manner.
27578468	no cancer	-1	0	Heart involvement in cystic fibrosis: A specific cystic fibrosis-related myocardial changes? Cystic fibrosis is a complex multi-systemic chronic disease characterized by progressive organ dysfunction with development of fibrosis, possibly affecting the heart. Over the last four decades pathological, experimental, and clinical evidence points towards the existence of a specific myocardial involvement in cystic fibrosis. Multi-modality cardiac imaging, especially recent echocardiographic techniques, evidenced diastolic and/or systolic ventricular dysfunction in cystic fibrosis leading to the concept of a cystic fibrosis-related cardiomyopathy. Hypoxemia and inflammation are among the most important factors for heart involvement in cystic fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator was found to be involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contraction and may also account for cystic fibrosis-related myocardial dysfunction. This review, mainly focused on echocardiographic studies, seeks to synthesize the existing literature for and against the existence of heart involvement in cystic fibrosis, its mechanisms and prognostic implications. Careful investigation of the heart function may be helpful for risk stratification and therapeutic decisions in patients with cystic fibrosis.

27582879	no cancer	-1	0	Use of proton-pump inhibitors among adults: a Danish nationwide drug utilization study. The use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased over the last decade. The objective of this study was to provide detailed utilization data on PPI use over time, with special emphasis on duration of PPI use and concomitant use of ulcerogenic drugs. Using the nationwide Danish Prescription Registry, we identified all Danish adults filling a PPI between 2002 and 2014. Using descriptive statistics, we reported (i) the distribution of use between single PPI entities, (ii) the development in incidence and prevalence of use over time, (iii) measures of duration and intensity of treatment, and (iv) the prevalence of use of ulcerogenic drugs among users of PPIs. We identified 1,617,614 adults using PPIs during the study period. The prevalence of PPI use increased fourfold during the study period to 7.4% of all Danish adults in 2014. PPI use showed strong age dependency, reaching more than 20% among those aged at least 80 years. The proportion of users maintaining treatment over time increased with increasing age, with less than10% of those aged 18-39 years using PPIs 2 years after their first prescription, compared with about 40% among those aged at least 80 years. The overall use of ulcerogenic drugs among PPI users increased moderately, from 35% of users of PPI in 2002 to 45% in 2014. The use of PPIs is extensive and increasing rapidly, especially among the elderly.
27593238	no cancer	-1	0	Phytoremediation applications in natural condition and in mesocosm: the uptake of Cadmium by Lemna minuta Kunth, a non native species in Italian watercourses. Metal pollution in water and soil is an environmental and public health issue. Cadmium is included in the list of priority hazardous substances in the European Water Framework Directive. Phytoremediation system is a cost-effective plant-based approach that takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. We studied the presence and the importance of an invasive species, such as Lemna minuta, in the environment and the effects of Cd pollution on this species. Growth, removal and tolerance were evaluated for different Cd concentration and different time of plant exposure. In the whole, the results show that L. minuta has a good capacity of growth, metal bioconcentration, and tolerance up to 3 days of exposure at 0.5 and 1.5 mg L(-1) of Cd. In particular, L. minuta was able to accumulate Cd up to 3771 mg Kg(-1) on dry mass basis. We can conclude that L. minuta possesses a great capability of Cd absorption and accumulation, thus supporting a potential use of this species in designing of a metal bioremediation system in phytoremediation field.
27579304	no cancer	-1	0	Pulse Wave Variation during the Menstrual Cycle in Women with Menstrual Pain. Objective. This study is performed to obtain objective diagnostic indicators associated with menstrual pain using pulse wave analysis. Methods. Using a pulse diagnostic device, we measured the pulse waves of 541 women aged between 19 and 30 years, placed in either an experimental group with menstrual pain (n = 329) or a control group with little or no menstrual pain (n = 212). Measurements were taken during both the menstrual and nonmenstrual periods, and comparative analysis was performed. Results. During the nonmenstrual period, the experimental group showed a significantly higher value in the left radial artery for the radial augmentation index (RAI) (p = 0.050) but significantly lower values for pulse wave energy (p = 0.021) and time to first peak from baseline (T1) (p = 0.035) in the right radial artery. During the menstrual period, the experimental group showed significantly lower values in the left radial artery for cardiac diastole and pulse wave area during diastole and significantly higher values for pulse wave area during systole, ratio of systolic phase to the full heartbeat, and systolic-diastolic ratio. Conclusion. We obtained indicators of menstrual pain in women during the menstrual period, including prolonged systolic and shortened diastolic phases, increases in pulse wave energy and area of representative pulse wave, and increased blood vessel resistance.

Chromosome segment substitution lines MBI9804, MBI9855, MBI9752, and MBI9134, which were obtained by advanced backcrossing and continuously inbreeding from an interspecific cross between CCRI36, a cultivar of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) as the recurrent parent, and Hai1, a cultivar of sea island cotton (G. barbadense) as the donor parent, were used to construct a multiple parent population of (MBI9804×MBI9855)×(MBI9752×MBI9134). The segregating generations of double-crossed F1 and F2 and F2:3 were used to map the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for fiber quality and yield-related traits. The recovery rate of the recurrent parent CCRI36 in the four parental lines was from 94.3%-96.9%. Each of the parental lines harbored 12-20 introgressed segments from Hai1across 21 chromosomes. The number of introgressed segments ranged from 1 to 27 for the individuals in the three generations, mostly from 9 to 18, which represented a genetic length of between 126 cM and 246 cM. A total of 24 QTLs controlling fiber quality and 11 QTLs controlling yield traits were detected using the three segregating generations. These QTLs were distributed across 11 chromosomes and could collectively explain 1.78%-20.27% of the observed phenotypic variations. Sixteen QTLs were consistently detected in two or more generations, four of them were for fiber yield traits and 12 were for fiber quality traits. One introgressed segment could significantly reduce both lint percentage and fiber micronaire. This study provides useful information for gene cloning and marker-assisted breeding for excellent fiber quality.

27576603	no cancer	-1	0	Vitamin B1-deficient mice show impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory formation and loss of hippocampal neurons and dendritic spines: potential microendophenotypes of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Patients with severe Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) associated with vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency (TD) show enduring impairment of memory formation. The mechanisms of memory impairment induced by TD remain unknown. Here, we show that hippocampal degeneration is a potential microendophenotype (an endophenotype of brain disease at the cellular and synaptic levels) of WKS in pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) mice, a rodent model of WKS. PTD mice show deficits in the hippocampus-dependent memory formation, although they show normal hippocampus-independent memory. Similarly with WKS, impairments in memory formation did not recover even at 6 months after treatment with PTD. Importantly, PTD mice exhibit a decrease in neurons in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus and reduced density of wide dendritic spines in the DG. Our findings suggest that TD induces hippocampal degeneration, including the loss of neurons and spines, thereby leading to enduring impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory formation.

27601599	no cancer	-1	0	Comprehensive proteomic analysis of human milk-derived extracellular vesicles unveils a novel functional proteome distinct from other milk components. Breast milk contains several macromolecular components with distinctive functions, whereby milk fat globules and casein micelles mainly provide nutrition to the newborn, while whey contains molecules that can stimulate the newborn's developing immune system and gastrointestinal tract. Although extracellular vesicles (EV) have been identified in breast milk, their physiological function and composition has not been addressed in detail. EV are submicron sized vehicles released by cells for intercellular communication via selectively incorporated lipids, nucleic acids and proteins. Due to the difficulty in separating EV from other milk components, an in-depth analysis of the proteome of human milk-derived EV is lacking. In this study, an extensive LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis was performed of EV that had been purified from breast milk of 7 individual donors using a recently established, optimized density-gradient-based EV isolation protocol. A total of 1963 proteins were identified in milk-derived EV, including EV-associated proteins like CD9, Annexin A5 and Flotillin-1, with a remarkable overlap between the different donors. Interestingly, 198 of the identified proteins are not present in the human EV database Vesiclepedia, indicating that milk-derived EV harbor proteins not yet identified in EV of different origin. Similarly, the proteome of milk-derived EV was compared to that of other milk components. For this, data from 38 published milk proteomic studies were combined in order to construct the total milk proteome, which consists of 2698 unique proteins. Remarkably, 633 proteins identified in milk-derived EV have not yet been identified in human milk to date. Interestingly, these novel proteins include proteins involved in regulation of cell growth and controlling inflammatory signaling pathways, suggesting that milk-derived EVs could support the newborn's developing gastrointestinal tract and immune system. Overall, this study provides an expansion of the whole milk proteome and illustrates that milk-derived EV are macromolecular components with a unique functional proteome.

The gravity changes obtained from GRACE data agreed well with those from dislocation theory in both magnitude and spatial pattern. Positive and negative gravity changes appeared on both sides of the epicenter. The positive signature appeared on the western side, and the peak value was approximately 0.4 microgal (1 microgal = 10(-8) m/s²), whereas on the eastern side, the gravity signature was negative, and the peak value was approximately -1.1 microgal. It demonstrates that deep-focus earthquakes Mw ≤ 8.5 are detectable by GRACE observations. Moreover, the coseismic displacements of 20 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations on the Earth's surface were simulated using an elastic dislocation theory in a spherical earth model, and the results are consistent with the GPS results, especially the near-field results. We also estimated the gravity contributions from the coseismic vertical displacements and density changes, analyzed the proportion of these two gravity change factors (based on an elastic dislocation theory in a spherical earth model) in this deep-focus earthquake. The gravity effect from vertical displacement is four times larger than that caused by density redistribution.
27588919	no cancer	-1	0	Improving access to pediatric neurorehabilitation for patients with moderate and severe head injuries. The majority of severely injured children in England have a significant head injury and will be seen in Major Trauma Centers (MTCs). The period following brain injury represents an opportunity to influence recovery of neurological function. The study sought to determine whether children who had sustained a head injury were referred for neurorehabilitation. The study was conducted over one year at one center. Children sustaining a moderate or severe head injury were identified and compared to those referred for neurorehabilitation. A total of 41 patients were identified; 16/41 (39%) were referred for neurorehabilitation. Group comparison revealed significant associations between referral status and age (X(2)(3) = 8.35, p = 0.039), injury mechanism (X(2)(1) = 8.12, p = 0.017), injury severity (X(2)(1) = 21.3, p < 0.000), and imaging findings (X(2)(1) = 11.71, p = 0.001). Data reveal concerns for access to neurorehabilitation. Improved access to neurorehabilitation permitting long-term follow-up is required. The establishment of MTCs provides an opportunity to enact this.
27582503	no cancer	-1	0	Effectiveness of continuous or intermittent vital signs monitoring in preventing adverse events on general wards: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Vital signs monitoring is an old hospital practice for patient safety but evaluation of its effectiveness is not widespread. We aimed to identify strategies to improve intermittent or continuous vital signs monitoring in general wards; and their effectiveness in preventing adverse events on general hospital wards. Publications searched between 1980 and June 2014 in five databases. Main outcome measures were in-hospital death, cardiac arrest, intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, length of stay, identification of physiological deterioration and activation of rapid response systems. Twenty-two studies assessing the effect of continuous (9) or intermittent monitoring (13) and reporting outcomes on 203,407 patients in-hospital wards across 13 countries were included in this review. Both monitoring practices led to early identification of patient deterioration, increased rapid response activations and improvements in timeliness or completeness of vital signs documentation. Innovative intermittent monitoring approaches are associated with modest reduction in in-hospital mortality over intermittent vital signs monitoring in 'usual care'. However, there was no evidence of significant reduction in ICU transfers or other adverse events with either intermittent or continuous monitoring. This review of heterogeneous monitoring approaches found no conclusive confirmation of improvements in prevention of cardiac arrest, reduction in length of hospital stay, or prevention of other neurological or cardiovascular adverse events. The evidence found to date is insufficient to recommend continuous vital signs monitoring in general wards as routine practice. Future evaluations of effectiveness need to be undertaken with more rigorous methods and homogeneous outcome measurements.
27578355	no cancer	-1	0	Insomnia: can acupuncture help? Insomnia is the forgotten partner to many medical problems, not least chronic pain where interference with sleep is a common complaint. However, the relationship is complex: lack of sleep can exacerbate pain through increase in proinflammatory cytokine production. Acupuncture is observed clinically to improve sleeping in chronic pain patients, but reviews are unable firmly to recommend acupuncture for insomnia as many trials are methodologically inadequate, despite most being acupuncture positive. However, there is strong evidence for relief in several chronic pain problems and improvement in these is likely also to restore normal sleeping. So, as the safety profile of acupuncture is excellent, it seems reasonable to utilize acupuncture in a nonpharmacological approach to combating insomnia, despite lack of formal evidence.
27588564	no cancer	-1	0	DOCA-Salt Hypertension Impairs Artery Function in Rat Middle Cerebral Artery and Parenchymal Arterioles. Chronic hypertension induces detrimental changes in the structure and function of surface cerebral arteries. Very little is known about parenchymal arterioles (PAs), which perfuse distinct neuronal populations in the cortex and may play a role in cerebrovascular disorders. We investigated the effect of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt induced hypertension on endothelial function and artery structure in PAs and middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). Uninephrectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a subcutaneous pellet containing DOCA (150 mg/kg b.w.) and drank salt-water (1% NaCl and 0.2% KCl) for 4 weeks. Sham rats were uninephrectomized and drank tap water. Vasoreactivity and passive structure in the MCAs and the PAs were assessed by pressure myography. Both MCAs and PAs from DOCA-salt rats exhibited impaired endothelium dependent dilation (p<0.05). In the PAs, addition of NO and COX inhibitors enhanced dilation in DOCA-salt rats (p<0.05) suggesting that dysfunctional NO and COX-dependent signaling could contribute to impaired endothelium-mediated dilation. MCAs from DOCA-salt rats exhibited inward remodeling (p<0.05). Hypertension-induced MCA remodeling coupled with impaired endothelium dependent dilation in both the MCAs and PAs may exacerbate the risk of cerebrovascular accidents and the associated morbidity and mortality.

27577041	no cancer	-1	0	"Osmophobia and olfactory functions in patients with migraine. Olfactory dysfunction and migraine has been associated for a long time. In this study, we planned to compare olfactory functions in patients with migraine and osmophobia with patients having migraine but no osmophobia, in addition with a normal control group using ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test. The main distinction of this study is that all qualitative and quantitative properties of olfactory functions; threshold, discrimination and identification, are evaluated separately and jointly. Thirty healthy person aged between 16 and 56 (18 women, 12 men) and 60 migraine patients aged between 15 and 54 (39 women, 21 man) were included in the study. All patients have been inquired about osmophobia and have been assessed with Hedonic tone assessment. Osmophobia has been tested for perfume, cigarette smoke, leather, stale food, soy sauce, fish, spices and coffee smells. Olfactory functions has been assessed with ""Sniffin' Sticks"" smell test. Thresholds, discrimination and identification have been determined for each patient. In migraine patients with osmophobia, threshold was 7.75 ± 2.3, in migraine patients without osmophobia threshold was 8.25 ± 1.5 and threshold was 10.75 ± 1.3 for the control group. Discrimination score was 6 ± 1.2 in migraine patients with osmophobia, 9 ± 0.8 in patients without osmophobia and was 12 ± 1.4 in the control group. In migraine patient with or without osmophobia Threshold/Discrimination/Identification (TDI) scores were lower than the control group. The most important parameter in our study is that discrimination scores were especially lower in patients with osmophobia. We believe that this decrease in discrimination in migraine patients with osmophobia; who claim that they smell everything and they are sensitive to all smells, is significant. Further studies about smell discrimination will help better understand some conditions; especially anosmia and hyposmia after upper respiratory tract infections and parosmia."
27596682	no cancer	-1	0	Crestal bone loss around submerged and non-submerged implants during the osseointegration phase with different healing abutment designs: a randomized prospective clinical study. To evaluate peri-implant crestal bone loss during the osseointegration period, comparing submerged and non-submerged implants with healing abutments of different design. A total of 90 Avinent(®) dental implants (Avinent Implant System, Barcelona, Spain) were placed in 90 patients. All were sited in the posterior mandibular zone to replace teeth 3.6 or 4.6. Patients were divided randomly into three groups: submerged (n = 30), non-submerged with anatomical healing abutment (n = 30), and non-submerged with esthetic healing abutment (n = 30). Peri-implant crestal bone loss was evaluated in intraoral radiographs taken at baseline, 1, and 3 months after implant placement. Peri-implant crestal bone loss at the end of the (3-month) osseointegration period was lowest in the submerged group (0.11 ± 0.14 mm), followed by the esthetic non-submerged group (0.15 ± 0.06 mm), but without statistically significant difference between these groups (P = 0.234). The greatest bone loss was produced in the non-submerged group with anatomical healing abutments (0.37 ± 0.12 mm), with significant differences between this group and the other two (P < 0.001). On the basis of these findings, bone resorption during the osseointegration period using the non-submerged technique varied significantly depending on the morphology of the healing abutment used. The non-submerged technique with an esthetic healing post-produced an equally predictable outcome compared with the submerged technique.
27586474	no cancer	-1	0	Differentially expressed genes in heads and tails of Angelica sinensis diels: Focusing on ferulic acid metabolism. To explore the scientific connotation of the discrepant pharmaceutical activities between the head and tail of Angelica sinensis diels (AS), an important herb extensively utilized in Chinese medicine, by the approach of transcriptome sequencing. Ten samples of AS were randomly collected in Min County, Gansu Province of China. Transcriptome sequencing of AS was accomplished in a commercial ILLumina HiSeq-2000 platform. The transcriptome of each head and tail of AS were fifixed in a gene chip, and detected under the procedure of Illumina HiSeq-2000. Differentially expressed unigenes between the heads and tails of AS were selected by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation (SBC) online analysis system, based on Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and relevant bioinformatic database. Totally 63,585 unigenes were obtained from AS by high-throughput sequencing platform. Among which 3359 unigenes were identified as differentially expressed unigenes between the heads and tails of AS by SBC analysis system scanning. Of which 15 differentially expressed unigenes participate in the metabolic regulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (PB) pathway and ferulic acid metabolites, in response to the distinguished pharmaceutical actions of the heads and tails of AS. Different content of ferulic acid in the heads and tails of AS is related to the differentially expressed genes, particularly involved in the PB pathway.
27577776	no cancer	-1	0	Hard X-ray phase-contrast tomography of non-homogeneous specimens: grating interferometry versus propagation-based imaging. X-ray phase-contrast imaging is an effective approach to drastically increase the contrast and sensitivity of microtomographic techniques. Numerous approaches to depict the real part of the complex-valued refractive index of a specimen are nowadays available. A comparative study using experimental data from grating-based interferometry and propagation-based phase contrast combined with single-distance phase retrieval applied to a non-homogeneous sample is presented (acquired at beamline ID19-ESRF). It is shown that grating-based interferometry can handle density gradients in a superior manner. The study underlines the complementarity of the two techniques for practical applications.
28324883	cancer	162	1	MET Amplification and Response to MET Inhibitors in Stage IV Lung Adenocarcinoma. Non-small-cell lung cancers with MET amplification may respond to c-MET inhibitors. We examined lung adenocarcinoma patients for mutations and amplification status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS, MET. The clinical characteristics of patients with MET amplification and their responses to MET inhibitor therapy were studied. Of the 76 patients analyzed, 5 were positive for c-MET gene amplification and 4 cases showed an intermediate result. For 12 patients who were EGFR positive, a c-MET analysis on secondary biopsy tissue was performed following disease progression. All 5 c-MET-positive patients were men. The age range in the study was 34-83 years. 4 of the 5 patients were started on crizotinib. 2 of these cases were positive following tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. 3 patients showed a response. 1 patient showed no response and was later found to have a concurrent T790M mutation. There are 2 categories of MET gene amplification in lung cancer patients, de novo and that secondary to TKI therapy. These patients can benefit from MET inhibitor therapy. Dual mechanisms of resistance, EGFR T790M mutation and c-MET amplification after TKI therapy, may suggest a poor prognosis.
27599777	no cancer	-1	0	CSF1 is involved in breast cancer progression through inducing monocyte differentiation and homing. Despite the great progress in breast cancer research and treatment, measures for efficient targeting of triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) are still lacking. The well‑established dependency of cancer cells on their microenvironment suggests that targeting the tumor niche might form a novel therapeutic approach. We identified the tumor‑associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry, and analyzed overall survival (OS). U937 co‑cultures with MDA‑MB‑231, MDA‑MB‑468 and MCF‑7, respectively, to simulate in vivo cellular interactions were assessed. In hormone‑independent breast cancer cell conditioned media (CM), U937 differentiates into M2 macrophage as identified by morphological changes and expression of specific surface antigens CD163 and CD204. Moreover, MDA‑MB‑231 recruits U937, and colony‑stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) level in MDA‑MB‑231 and MDA‑MB‑468 CM is much higher than that of MCF‑7. Overexpression of CSF1 in MCF‑7 fails to rebuild its aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo since CSF1 was not found extracellularly, while genetic inhibition of CSF1 in MDA‑MB‑231 abrogates TAM infiltration and consequently reduces tumorigenesis in non‑obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Using various strategies we demonstrate that CSF1‑induced TAMs specifically support breast cancer progression. Importantly, our results may reveal the efficacy of using targeted therapy against tumor niche and indicate that CSF1 inhibition may limit some breast cancer progression.
27603677	no cancer	-1	0	Biosynthesis of cell wall mannan in the conidium and the mycelium of Aspergillus fumigatus. The galactomannan is a major cell wall molecule of Aspergillus fumigatus. This molecule is composed of a linear mannan with a repeating unit composed of four α1,6 and α1,2 linked mannose with side chains of galactofuran. To obtain a better understanding of the mannan biosynthesis in A. fumigatus, it was decided to undertake the successive deletion of the 11 genes which are putative orthologs of the mannosyltransferases responsible for establishing α1,6 and α1,2 mannose linkages in yeast. These deletions did not lead to a reduction of the mannan content of the cell wall of the mycelium of A. fumigatus. In contrast, the mannan content of the conidial cell wall was reduced and this reduction was associated with a partial disorganisation of the cell wall leading to defects in conidial survival both in vitro and in vivo.

We report on an 8-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), speech delay, behavioural problems, disturbed sleep and macrosomia including macrocephaly carrying a microdeletion that contains the entire NCAM2 gene and no other functional genes. Other family members with the microdeletion show a large skull circumference but do not exhibit any symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Among many ASD-candidate genes, NCAM2 has been assumed to play a pivotal role in the development of ASD because of its function in the outgrowth and bundling of neurites. Our reported case raises the questions whether the NCAM2-deletion is the true cause of the ASD or only a risk factor and whether there might be any connection in NCAM2 with skull-size Key words: autism spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, neural cell adhesion molecule 2 protein (NCAM2), array comparative genomic hybridization (microarray).
27593797	no cancer	-1	0	The effect of cerebro-spinal fluid in collagen guide channel on sciatic nerve regeneration in rat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) in nerve regeneration across the collagen guide channel in comparison with autograft. Forty adult male rats (250-300g) were randomized into (1) collagen channel + CSF, (2) collagen channel + normal saline (NS), (3) autograft, and (4) sham surgery groups. The left sciatic nerve was exposed and a 10mm nerve segment was cut and removed. In the collagen groups, the proximal and distal cuts ends of sciatic nerve were telescoped into the nerve guides and CSF or NS injected into collagen conduit. To the autograft group, the 10 mm nerve segment was turned backwards and used an autologous nerve graft. All animals were evaluated by sciatic functional index (SFI) and electrophysiology, histology, and immunohistochemistry testing. The improvements in SFI since the beginning of the last evaluation in experimental groups were measured. On days 49 and 60 post-operation, the mean SFI of the collagen + CSF group was significantly greater than the autograft group (P 0.05). On day 90, the mean nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of the collagen + CSF group was greater than autograft group (P 0.05). The number of myelinated fibers in the collagen + CSF group was significantly greater than that of the collagen + NS group at day 90 (P 0.05). These findings showed that CSF in collagen nerve guide channel effectively enhances nerve regeneration and promotes functional recovery in injured sciatic nerve of rats.
27591392	no cancer	-1	0	The role of DNA polymerase ζ in translesion synthesis across bulky DNA adducts and cross-links in human cells. Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) is a cellular defense mechanism against genotoxins. Defects or mutations in specialized DNA polymerases (Pols) involved in TLS are believed to result in hypersensitivity to various genotoxic stresses. Here, DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ)-deficient (KO: knockout) and Pol ζ catalytically dead (CD) human cells were established and their sensitivity towards cytotoxic activities of various genotoxins was examined. The CD cells were engineered by altering the DNA sequence encoding two amino acids essential for the catalytic activity of Pol ζ, i.e., D2781 and D2783, to alanines. Both Pol ζ KO and CD cells displayed a prolonged cell cycle and higher incidence of micronuclei formation than the wild-type (WT) cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic treatments, and the order of abnormality was CD>KO>WT cells. Both KO and CD cells exhibited higher sensitivity towards the killing effects of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, mitomycin C, potassium bromate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and ultraviolet C irradiation than WT cells, and there were no differences between the sensitivities of KO and CD cells. Interestingly, neither KO nor CD cells were sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. Since KO and CD cells displayed similar sensitivities to the genotoxins, we employed only KO cells to further examine their sensitivity to other genotoxic agents. KO cells were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, styrene oxide, cisplatin, methyl methanesulfonate, and ethyl methanesulfonate than WT cells. However, the KO cells displayed sensitivity camptothecin, etoposide, bleomycin, hydroxyurea, crotonealdehyde, and methylglyoxal in a manner similar to the WT cells. Our results suggest that Pol ζ plays an important role in the protection of human cells by carrying out TLS across bulky DNA adducts and cross-links, but has no or limited role in the protection against strand-breaks in DNA.
21890455	gastrointestinal system cancer	3119	1	Toll-like receptor 9 agonist IMO cooperates with cetuximab in K-ras mutant colorectal and pancreatic cancers. K-Ras somatic mutations are a strong predictive biomarker for resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer. We previously showed that the novel Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist immunomodulatory oligonucleotide (IMO) has a strong in vivo activity in colorectal cancer models by interfering with EGFR-related signaling and synergizing with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. In the present study, we investigated, both in vitro and in vivo, the antitumor effect of IMO alone or in combination with cetuximab in subcutaneous colon and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models harboring K-Ras mutations and resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We showed that IMO was able to significantly restore the sensitivity of K-Ras mutant cancer cells to cetuximab, producing a marked inhibition of cell survival and a complete suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, when used in combination with cetuximab. IMO interfered with EGFR-dependent signaling, modulating the functional interaction between TLR9 and EGFR. In vivo, IMO plus cetuximab combination caused a potent and long-lasting cooperative antitumor activity in LS174T colorectal cancer and in orthotopic AsPC1 pancreatic cancer. The capability of IMO to restore cetuximab sensitivity was further confirmed by using K-Ras mutant colorectal cancer cell models obtained through homologous recombination technology. We showed that IMO markedly inhibits growth of K-Ras mutant colon and pancreatic cancers in vitro and in nude mice and cooperates with cetuximab via multiple mechanisms of action. Therefore, we propose IMO plus cetuximab as a therapeutic strategy for K-Ras wild-type as well for K-Ras mutant, cetuximab-resistant colorectal and pancreatic cancers.
27592429	no cancer	-1	0	Prevalence of cytological endometritis and effect on pregnancy outcomes at the time of insemination in nulliparous dairy heifers. The objectives of the present study were to assess the prevalence of cytological endometritis (CYTO) at the time of artificial insemination (AI) and its effect on pregnancy outcomes in nulliparous dairy heifers. In total, 512 endometrial cytology samples were taken during AI from 351 nulliparous Holstein-Friesian heifers using cytotape (a 1.5-cm piece of paper tape rolled on the top of an AI catheter covered with a double guard sheet). After sampling, the top of the AI catheter was gently rolled onto a glass slide, air-dried, and stained using Diff-Quick (Fisher Diagnostics, Newark, DE). For each slide, 300 nucleated cells were counted, and the polymorphonuclear cell ratio (% PMN) was assessed at 400× magnification. We constructed a receiver operating characteristic curve to find the cutoff point at which sensitivity and specificity (% PMN) affected pregnancy outcomes. The receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that the threshold level for diagnosing CYTO in nulliparous dairy heifers was 1% PMN. An insemination was considered successful when pregnancy was confirmed by rectal palpation at least 45 d post-AI. Heifers were considered not pregnant when they received a subsequent insemination or were diagnosed empty by rectal palpation. We built multilevel generalized mixed-effect models to test factors affecting pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of CYTO at AI. We excluded 16 samples harvested from 12 heifers due to poor sample quality or unavailability of reproductive data. Of the 496 AI samples, the prevalence of CYTO at AI was 7.86% (n = 39). The conception rate was 62.8% (n = 287) in CYTO-negative samples (n = 457) and 38.46% (n = 15) in CYTO-positive samples. Risk factors for non-pregnancy were a previous AI (odds ratio 2.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.21-7.26) and the interaction between CYTO and previous AI. The only risk factor identified as being associated with the occurrence of CYTO was a previous AI (odds ratio 4.7; 95% confidence interval: 2.15-10.34). The performance of unsuccessful inseminations significantly affects reproductive outcomes in subsequent AI and may lead to CYTO in nulliparous dairy heifers.
27596284	no cancer	-1	0	Effect of polymorphisms in the CD36 and STAT3 genes on different dietary interventions among patients with coronary artery disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Cardiovascular disease has become a major health problem, and it has been associated with both environmental and genetic factors. Studies have shown that the Mediterranean Diet (MeDiet), or its components such as nuts and olive oil, may be strongly associated with the improvement of cardiovascular risk factors in specific populations. The purpose of the GENUTRI study is to investigate the interaction of genetics with cardiovascular risk factors in a non-Mediterranean population with coronary artery disease (CAD) according to three different diets: rich in pecan nuts, in extra-virgin olive oil or a control diet. The GENUTRI study is a single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 12-week pragmatic clinical trial conducted in patients aged 40 to 80 years and diagnosed with CAD. A standardized questionnaire will be applied to data collection and a blood sample will be obtained for lipid, glycemic and inflammatory profile evaluation. Polymorphisms in the CD36 and STAT3 genes will be detected using the TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assay. Patients will be allocated in three groups: group 1: 30 g/day of pecan nuts; group 2: 30 ml/day of olive oil; and group 3: control diet. The primary outcome will consist of changes in LDL-cholesterol (in mg/dl) after 12 weeks of intervention. Studies have shown the beneficial effects of diets rich in nuts and olive oil mainly in the Mediterranean population. GENUTRI is a clinical trial focusing on the effects of nuts or olive oil supplementation in Brazilian individuals. Additionally, we will try to demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms linked to cardiovascular disease may modulate the effects of different diets on biochemical and inflammatory markers among these subjects.

27579148	no cancer	-1	0	Gasotransmitters in Gametogenesis and Early Development: Holy Trinity for Assisted Reproductive Technology-A Review. Creation of both gametes, sperm and oocyte, and their fusion during fertilization are essential step for beginning of life. Although molecular mechanisms regulating gametogenesis, fertilization, and early embryonic development are still subjected to intensive study, a lot of phenomena remain unclear. Based on our best knowledge and own results, we consider gasotransmitters to be essential for various signalisation in oocytes and embryos. In accordance with nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) physiological necessity, their involvement during oocyte maturation and regulative role in fertilization followed by embryonic development have been described. During these processes, NO- and H2S-derived posttranslational modifications represent the main mode of their regulative effect. While NO represent the most understood gasotransmitter and H2S is still intensively studied gasotransmitter, appreciation of carbon monoxide (CO) role in reproduction is still missing. Overall understanding of gasotransmitters including their interaction is promising for reproductive medicine and assisted reproductive technologies (ART), because these approaches contend with failure of in vitro assisted reproduction.
27586266	no cancer	-1	0	Fat body and hemocyte contribution to the antimicrobial peptide synthesis in Calliphora vicina R.-D. (Diptera: Calliphoridae) larvae. Antimicrobial peptides accumulated in the hemolymph in response to infection are a key element of insect innate immunity. The involvement of the fat body and hemocytes in the antimicrobial peptide synthesis is widely acknowledged, although release of the peptides present in the hemolymph from the immune cells was not directly verified so far. Here, we studied the presence of antimicrobial peptides in the culture medium of fat body cells and hemocytes isolated from the blue blowfly Calliphora vicina using complex of liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and antimicrobial activity assays. Both fat body and hemocytes are shown to synthesize and release to culture medium defensin, cecropin, diptericins, and proline-rich peptides. The spectra of peptide antibiotics released by the fat body and hemocytes partially overlap. Thus, the results suggest that insect fat body and blood cells are capable of releasing mature antimicrobial peptides to the hemolymph. It is notable that the data obtained demonstrate dramatic difference in the functioning of insect antimicrobial peptides and their mammalian counterparts localized into blood cells' phagosomes where they exert their antibacterial activity.
27579991	no cancer	-1	0	Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Erythropoietin in the TNBS-induced Colitis. Erythropoietin is a potent stimulator of erythroid progenitor cells, which is able to inhibit NF-kB activation, due to its pleiotropic properties, thus promoting an anti-inflammatory effect. Since inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic disease with reduced quality of life, and the current pharmacotherapy only induces or maintains the patient in remission, there is a crucial need of new pharmacological approaches. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of erythropoietin in the TNBS-induced colitis model in mice with a normal intestinal flora. Mice with TNBS-induced colitis were treated with a daily dose of erythropoietin at 500 IU/kg bw/day and 1000 IU/Kg bw/day IP during 4 days. As to clinical symptoms/signs, erythropoietin attenuated the decreased body weight and reduced diarrhoea and edema of the anus registered in the non-treated mice group in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory properties of erythropoietin in the TNBS-induced colitis were confirmed by suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and MPO, as well as a significant increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was promoted. These treated mice also presented a reduction of hemoglobin fecal and ALP, suggesting a beneficial effect of erythropoietin in the hemorrhagic focus and destruction of the enterocyte associated to the colon injury induced by TNBS, respectively. The histopathological score was reduced after treatment with erythropoietin, decreasing the severity and extension of the colitis. Furthermore, renal and hepatic biomarkers, as well as hematocrit concentration remained stabilized after treatment. In conclusion, erythropoietin reduces the inflammatory response associated with TNBS-induced colitis in mice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
27588725	no cancer	-1	0	Determination of dopamine hydrochloride by host-guest interaction based on water-soluble pillar[5]arene. The supramolecular interaction between the water-soluble pillar[5]arene (WP[5]) as host and dopamine hydrochloride (DH) as guest was studied by spectrofluorometry. The fluorescence intensity of DH gradually decreased with increasing WP[5] concentration, and the possible interaction mechanism between WP[5] and DH was confirmed by (1)H NMR, 2D NOESY, and molecular modelling. Based on significant DH fluorescence, a highly sensitive and selective method for DH determination was developed for the first time. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 312nm, with excitation at 285nm. The effects of pH, temperature, and reaction time on the fluorescence spectra of the WP[5]-DH complex were investigated. A linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and DH concentration in the range of 0.07-6.2μgmL(-1) was obtained. The corresponding linear regression equation is ΔF=25.76 C+13.56 (where C denotes the concentration in μgmL(-1)), with the limit of detection equal to 0.03μgmL(-1) and the correlation coefficient equal to 0.9996. This method can be used for the determination of dopamine in injection and urine samples. In addition, the WP[5]-DH complex has potential applications in fluorescent sensing and pharmacokinetics studies of DH.
27591764	no cancer	-1	0	Histopathological findings of extra-ileal manifestations at initial diagnosis of Crohn's disease-related ileitis. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Our objective was to review the histological findings in index biopsies from the terminal ileum and other gastro-intestinal tract sites of Crohn's disease patients prior any treatment and to compare them with the findings from patients with non-specific ileitis. A total of 111 consecutive Crohn's disease cases (55 females, median age 27 years) with extra-ileal biopsies were retrospectively selected. Upper gastrointestinal inflammatory changes were found in 68 % of gastric biopsies, 60 % of oesophageal biopsies and 43 % of duodenal biopsies with no significant difference in frequency between paediatric and adult cases. Crohn's colitis was more common in paediatric cases than adult cases (85 % versus 57 %). Granuloma in at least one extra-ileal site was observed in 40 %, more frequently in paediatric cases than in adults (78 vs 27 %). Compared with Crohn's disease cases, the group of 151 non-specific ileitis cases (75 females, median age 52 years) were more likely to have normal upper and lower gastrointestinal biopsies and to show less frequent crypt architectural changes in the terminal ileum. In summary, Crohn's disease ileitis is often associated with inflammation elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract while non-specific ileitis was infrequently associated with inflammation elsewhere for both paediatric and adult patients. These findings support the role of systematic biopsies in multiple gastrointestinal sites to help distinguishing Crohn's ileitis from non-specific ileitis in paediatric and adult population.
27595479	no cancer	-1	0	Electroencephalography Is a Good Complement to Currently Established Dementia Biomarkers. Dementia biomarkers that are accessible and easily applicable in nonspecialized clinical settings are urgently needed. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is a good candidate, and the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) method has recently provided promising results. We tested the diagnostic value of qEEG-SPR in comparison to cognition, structural imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. A total of 511 individuals were recruited from the multicenter NORD EEG study [141 healthy controls, 64 subjective cognitive decline, 124 mild cognitive impairment, 135 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 15 dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease with dementia (DLB/PDD), 32 other dementias]. The EEG data were recorded in a standardized way. Structural imaging data were visually rated using scales of atrophy in the medial temporal, frontal, and posterior cortex. qEEG-SPR outperformed structural imaging, cognition, and CSF biomarkers in DLB/PDD diagnosis, outperformed structural imaging in AD diagnosis, and improved the differential diagnosis of AD. In addition, qEEG-SPR allowed differentiation of two clinically different AD subtypes. Adding qEEG to the diagnostic workup substantially increases the detection of AD pathology even in pre-dementia stages and improves differential diagnosis. EEG could serve as a good complement to currently established dementia biomarkers since it is cheap, noninvasive, and extensively applied outside academic centers.
27579587	no cancer	-1	0	Ethambutol induces testicular damage and decreases the sperm functional competence in Swiss albino mice. The present study reports the effect of ethambutol (EMB) on testicular function. Prepubertal and adult male Swiss albino mice were treated with 40, 80, 160mg/kg body weight of EMB, intraperitoneally, every alternate day for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks gap, mice were sacrificed to collect caudal spermatozoa. EMB treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the testicular weight, sperm count and motility while the percentage of sperm with head abnormalities, immature chromatin (P<0.001) and DNA damage increased (P<0.01). In addition, EMB treatment resulted in significant depletion of glutathione (P<0.05-P<0.01) and histopathological abnormalities such as large cells, vacuolation of tubules and isolated colonies of spermatogenic cells were observed. Oct4, 17β-Hsd and c-Kit mRNA was marginally elevated in EMB treated testes at the highest dose studied. In conclusion, the result of the present study indicates that EMB has adverse effect on testicular function and impairs the sperm functional competence.
27600574	no cancer	-1	0	Postural stability after patient-specific interpositional knee spacer or total knee arthroplasty: a comparative study. Total knee arthroplasty provides excellent results concerning functional demands, patient satisfaction and range of motion. Short-term results after implantation of patient-specific knee spacers also show encouraging results. We hypothesised that patient-specific interpositional devices provide better proprioception and postural stability by preserving the whole bone stock and both cruciate ligaments. In this study we compared functional results, proprioception and postural stability 16 months after 20 consecutive patient-specific interpositional device implantations of the knee (group A) and 20 consecutive total knee arthroplasties (group B). Patients were evaluated using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Postural stability was analysed during single leg stance on a force platform (Biodex). There were no significant differences between both groups concerning functional results 16 months after the procedure. Concerning postural stability, significant differences were found between both groups. Comparing the operated-on and non-operated-on sides in single leg stance, the operated-on leg gained the same stability as the non-operated-on side in both groups. The successful treatment of knee osteoarthritis can restore postural stability to the level of the unaffected side-independent from the implanted devices and with preservation of soft tissue and bone stock. Superior postural stability in joint-preserving patient-specific interpositional knee devices compared with total knee arthroplasty had to be attributed to the different age of both groups.
27578364	no cancer	-1	0	No convincing association between post-operative delirium and post-operative cognitive dysfunction: a secondary analysis. Post-operative delirium and post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are both common but it has not been clarified how closely they are associated. We aimed to assess the possible relationship in a secondary analysis of data from the 'Surgery Depth of anaesthesia and Cognitive outcome'- study. We included patients aged ≥ 60 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery planned for longer than 60 min. Delirium was assessed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) as well as within the first week after surgery. Cognitive function was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. Multivariable analysis of POCD was performed with consideration of predisposing and precipitating factors. Of 1277 randomized patients, 850 (66.6%) had complete data. Delirium was found in 270 patients (32.9% of 850). We detected POCD in 162 (20.9% of 776) at 1 week and in 52 (9.4% of 553) at 3 months. In multivariable analysis (n = 808), delirium had no overall effect on POCD (P = 0.30). Patients with no delirium in PACU but with postoperative delirium within 7 days had an increased risk of POCD at 3 months (OR = 2.56 (95%-confidence interval: 1.07-6.16), P = 0.035). No significant association was found for the other subgroups. There is no clear evidence that postoperative delirium is independently associated with POCD up to 3 months.

The aging of the population, along with rising life expectancy, means that increasing numbers of older men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and a large proportion of these men will present with metastatic disease. In this paper, we discuss recent advances in prostate cancer treatment. In particular, we review management approaches for older patients with metastatic prostate cancer based on the decision tree developed by the International Society of Geriatric Oncology, which categorized older men as ""fit,"" ""vulnerable,"" and ""frail"" according to comprehensive geriatric assessment."
27581648	no cancer	-1	0	mTOR signaling regulates myotube hypertrophy by modulating protein synthesis, rDNA transcription and chromatin remodeling. Ribosome production is an early event during skeletal muscle hypertrophy and precedes muscle protein accretion. Signaling via mTOR is crucial for ribosome production and hypertrophy, however the mechanisms by which it regulates these processes remain to be identified. Herein, we investigated the activation of mTOR signaling in hypertrophying myotubes, and determined that mTOR coordinates various aspects of gene expression important for ribosome production. First, inhibition of translation with cycloheximide had a more potent effect on protein synthesis than Rapamycin indicating that mTOR function during hypertrophy is not on general, but rather specific protein synthesis. Second, blocking Pol II transcription had a similar effect as Rapamycin and unexpectedly, revealed the necessity of Pol II transcription for Pol I transcription, suggesting that mTOR may regulate ribosome production also by controlling Class II genes at the transcription level. Third, Pol I activity is essential for rDNA transcription, and surprisingly, for protein synthesis as selective Pol I inhibition blunted rDNA transcription, protein synthesis and the hypertrophic response of myotubes. Finally, mTOR has nuclear localization in muscle, which is not sensitive to Rapamycin. Inhibition of mTOR signaling by Rapamycin disrupted mTOR-rDNA promoter interaction, and resulted in altered histone marks indicative of repressed transcription and formation of higher order chromatin structure. Thus mTOR signaling appears to regulate muscle hypertrophy by affecting protein synthesis, Class I and II gene expression and chromatin remodeling.
27594985	no cancer	-1	0	Whole-genome sequencing of nine esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is highly mutated and molecularly heterogeneous. The number of cell lines available for study is limited and their genome has been only partially characterized. The availability of an accurate annotation of their mutational landscape is crucial for accurate experimental design and correct interpretation of genotype-phenotype findings. We performed high coverage, paired end whole genome sequencing on eight EAC cell lines-ESO26, ESO51, FLO-1, JH-EsoAd1, OACM5.1 C, OACP4 C, OE33, SK-GT-4-all verified against original patient material, and one esophageal high grade dysplasia cell line, CP-D. We have made available the aligned sequence data and report single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and copy number alterations, identified by comparison with the human reference genome and known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We compare these putative mutations to mutations found in primary tissue EAC samples, to inform the use of these cell lines as a model of EAC.
27595596	no cancer	-1	0	GM-CSF primes cardiac inflammation in a mouse model of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of pediatric heart disease in developed countries. KD patients develop cardiac inflammation, characterized by an early infiltrate of neutrophils and monocytes that precipitates coronary arteritis. Although the early inflammatory processes are linked to cardiac pathology, the factors that regulate cardiac inflammation and immune cell recruitment to the heart remain obscure. In this study, using a mouse model of KD (induced by a cell wall Candida albicans water-soluble fraction [CAWS]), we identify an essential role for granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in orchestrating these events. GM-CSF is rapidly produced by cardiac fibroblasts after CAWS challenge, precipitating cardiac inflammation. Mechanistically, GM-CSF acts upon the local macrophage compartment, driving the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, whereas therapeutically, GM-CSF blockade markedly reduces cardiac disease. Our findings describe a novel role for GM-CSF as an essential initiating cytokine in cardiac inflammation and implicate GM-CSF as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in KD.
23555837	cancer	162	1	Genetic interactions between neurofibromin and endothelin receptor B in mice. When mutations in two different genes produce the same mutant phenotype, it suggests that the encoded proteins either interact with each other, or act in parallel to fulfill a similar purpose. Haploinsufficiency of Neurofibromin and over-expression of Endothelin 3 both cause increased numbers of melanocytes to populate the dermis during mouse development, and thus we are interested in how these two signaling pathways might intersect. Neurofibromin is mutated in the human genetic disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by the development of Schwann cell based tumors and skin hyper-pigmentation. Neurofibromin is a GTPase activating protein, while the Endothelin 3 ligand activates Endothelin receptor B, a G protein coupled receptor. In order to study the genetic interactions between endothelin and neurofibromin, we defined the deletion breakpoints of the classical Ednrb piebald lethal allele (Ednrb(s-l) ) and crossed these mice to mice with a loss-of-function mutation in neurofibromin, Dark skin 9 (Dsk9). We found that Neurofibromin haploinsufficiency requires Endothelin receptor B to darken the tail dermis. In contrast, Neurofibromin haploinsufficiency increases the area of the coat that is pigmented in Endothelin receptor B null mice. We also found an oncogenic mutation in the G protein alpha subunit, GNAQ, which couples to Endothelin receptor B, in a uveal melanoma from a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1. Thus, this data suggests that there is a complex relationship between Neurofibromin and Endothelin receptor B.
27603167	no cancer	-1	0	The Impact of Interpersonal and Noninterpersonal Trauma on Psychological Symptoms in Refugees: The Moderating Role of Gender and Trauma Type. Research findings have documented a relationship between the number of types of traumatic events to which refugees were exposed and psychological disorders. It is unclear, however, if gender moderates the impact of trauma on refugee mental health. The participants in this study were 60 male and 31 female refugees and asylum-seekers resettled in Australia. Participants had a mean age of 34.54 years (SD = 9.70), and were from a variety of countries including Iraq, Iran, and Sri Lanka. We conducted a multigroup path analysis to test if the relationship between psychological outcomes of exposure to trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression) was different as a function of the type of traumatic exposure (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) or as a function of gender. We found a significant relationship between interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (β = .77) and anxiety symptoms (β = .32) in women, and a significant association between noninterpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (β = .59), anxiety (β =.49), and depression symptoms (β = .32) in men. For men, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = 0.14 to 1.01; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = -0.53 to 0.43. For women, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = -0.79 to 0.67; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = -0.09 to 1.46. These results suggested supporting refugees in their efforts to overcome the psychological impact of trauma, including the allocation of resources in clinical services to support the psychological recovery of refugees.
27600683	no cancer	-1	0	Post-mortem assessment in vascular dementia: advances and aspirations. Cerebrovascular lesions are a frequent finding in the elderly population. However, the impact of these lesions on cognitive performance, the prevalence of vascular dementia, and the pathophysiology behind characteristic in vivo imaging findings are subject to controversy. Moreover, there are no standardised criteria for the neuropathological assessment of cerebrovascular disease or its related lesions in human post-mortem brains, and conventional histological techniques may indeed be insufficient to fully reflect the consequences of cerebrovascular disease. Here, we review and discuss both the neuropathological and in vivo imaging characteristics of cerebrovascular disease, prevalence rates of vascular dementia, and clinico-pathological correlations. We also discuss the frequent comorbidity of cerebrovascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease pathology, as well as the difficult and controversial issue of clinically differentiating between Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and mixed Alzheimer's disease/vascular dementia. Finally, we consider additional novel approaches to complement and enhance current post-mortem assessment of cerebral human tissue. Elucidation of the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease, clarification of characteristic findings of in vivo imaging and knowledge about the impact of combined pathologies are needed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnoses.
27600147	no cancer	-1	0	The Effect of Dietary Nitrate Supplementation on Endurance Exercise Performance in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Recent research into the use of dietary nitrates and their role in vascular function has led to it becoming progressively more popular amongst athletes attempting to enhance performance. The objective of this review was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the effect of dietary nitrate (NO3 (-)) supplementation on endurance exercise performance. An additional aim was to determine whether the performance outcomes are affected by potential moderator variables. Relevant databases such as Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for the following search terms 'nitrates OR nitrate OR beetroot OR table beet OR garden beet OR red beet AND exercise AND performance' from inception to October 2015. Studies were included if a placebo versus dietary nitrate-only supplementation protocol was able to be compared, and if a quantifiable measure of exercise performance was ≥30 s (for a single bout of exercise or the combined total for multiple bouts). The literature search identified 1038 studies, with 47 (76 trials) meeting the inclusion criteria. Data from the 76 trials were extracted for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted for time trial (TT) (n = 28), time to exhaustion (TTE) (n = 22) and graded-exercise test (GXT) (n = 8) protocols. Univariate meta-regression was used to assess potential moderator variables (exercise type, dose duration, NO3 (-) type, study quality, fitness level and percentage nitrite change). Pooled analysis identified a trivial but non-significant effect in favour of dietary NO3 (-) supplementation [effect size (ES) = -0.10, 95 % Cl = -0.27 to 0.06, p > 0.05]. TTE trials had a small to moderate statistically significant effect in favour of dietary NO3 (-) supplementation (ES = 0.33, 95 % Cl = 0.15-0.50, p < 0.01). GXT trials had a small but non-significant effect in favour of dietary NO3 (-) supplementation in GXT performance measures (ES = 0.25, 95 % Cl = -0.06 to 0.56, p > 0.05). No significant heterogeneity was detected in the meta-analysis. No statistically significant effects were observed from the meta-regression analysis. Dietary NO3 (-) supplementation is likely to elicit a positive outcome when testing endurance exercise capacity, whereas dietary NO3 (-) supplementation is less likely to be effective for time-trial performance. Further work is needed to understand the optimal dosing strategies, which population is most likely to benefit, and under which conditions dietary nitrates are likely to be most effective for performance.
27587521	no cancer	-1	0	Correction of moderate to severe hallux valgus with combined proximal opening wedge and distal chevron osteotomies: a reliable technique. The mainstay of surgical correction of hallux valgus is first metatarsal osteotomy, either proximally or distally. We present a technique of combining a distal chevron osteotomy with a proximal opening wedge osteotomy, for the correction of moderate to severe hallux valgus. We reviewed 45 patients (49 feet) who had undergone double osteotomy. Outcome was assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and the Short Form (SF) -36 Health Survey scores. Radiological measurements were undertaken to assess the correction. The mean age of the patients was 60.8 years (44.2 to 75.3). The mean follow-up was 35.4 months (24 to 51). The mean AOFAS score improved from 54.7 to 92.3 (p < 0.001) and the mean SF-36 score from 59 to 86 (p < 0.001). The mean hallux valgus and intermetatarsal angles were improved from 41.6(o) to 12.8(o) (p < 0.001) and from 22.1(o) to 7.1(o), respectively (p < 0.001). The mean distal metatarsal articular angle improved from 23(o) to 9.7(o). The mean sesamoid position, as described by Hardy and Clapham, improved from 6.8 to 3.5. The mean length of the first metatarsal was unchanged. The overall rate of complications was 4.1% (two patients). These results suggest that a double osteotomy of the first metatarsal is a reliable, safe technique which, when compared with other metatarsal osteotomies, provides strong angular correction and excellent outcomes with a low rate of complications.

27591777	no cancer	-1	0	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of two loci conferring resistance to Phytophthora sojae in soybean. RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 were fine mapped to two genomic regions harboring disease resistance-like genes. The haplotypes and instability of the regions and candidate genes for the two resistance loci were characterized. Phytophthora root and stem rot caused by Phytophthora sojae, is one of the most destructive diseases of soybean. Deploying soybean cultivars carrying race-specific resistance conferred by Rps genes is the most practical approach to managing this disease. Previously, two Rps genes, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 were identified in a landrace PI 567139B and mapped to a 6.5 cM region on chromosome 3 and a 3.0 cM region on chromosome 16, corresponding to 1387 and 423 kb of the soybean reference genome sequences. By analyzing recombinants defined by genotypic and phenotypic screening of the 826 F2:3 families derived from two reciprocal crosses between the two parental lines, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2, were further narrowed to a 151 kb region that harbors five genes including three disease resistance (R)-like genes, and a 36 kb region that contains four genes including five R-like genes, respectively, according to the reference genome. Expressional changes of these nine genes before and after inoculation with the pathogen, as revealed by RNA-seq, suggest that Glyma.03g034600 in the RpsUN1 region and Glyma.16g215200 and Glyma.16g214900 in the RpsUN2 region of PI 567139B may be associated with the resistance to P. sojae. It is also suggested that unequal recombination between/among R-like genes may have occurred, resulting in the formation of two recombinants with inconsistent genotypic and phenotypic observations. The haplotype variation of genomic regions where RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 reside in the entire soybean germplasm deposited in the US soybean germplasm collection suggests that RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 are most likely novel genes.
27592173	no cancer	-1	0	ROP6 is involved in root hair deformation induced by Nod factors in Lotus japonicus. Roots of leguminous plants perceive Nod factor signals, and then root hair deformation responses such as swelling and curling are activated. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of such root hair deformation. We have previously shown that LjROP6, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, was identified as an NFR5 (Nod Factor Receptor 5)-interacting protein and participated in symbiotic nodulation in Lotus japonicus. In this study, we identified ten LjROP GTPases including LjROP6, and they were distributed into groups II, III, IV but not group I by phylogenetic analysis. The expression profiles of ten LjROP genes during nodulation were examined. LjROP6 belonged to group IV and interacted with NFR5 in a GTP-dependent manner. Overexpression of either wild-type ROP6 or a constitutively active mutant (ROP6-CA) generated root hair tip growth depolarization, while overexpression of a dominant negative mutant (ROP6-DN) exhibited normal root hair growth. After inoculating with Mesorhizobium loti or adding Nod factors to hairy roots, overexpression of ROP6 and ROP6-CA exhibited extensive root hair deformation, while overexpression of ROP6-DN inhibited root hair deformation. The infection event and nodule number were increased in ROP6 and ROP6-CA overexpressing transgenic plants; but decreased in ROP6-DN overexpressing transgenic plants. These studies provide strong evidence that ROP6 GTPase, which binds NFR5 in a GTP-dependent manner, is involved in root hair development as well as root hair deformation responses induced by NFs in the early stage of symbiotic interaction in L. japonicus.
27581336	no cancer	-1	0	IBIS: an OR ready open-source platform for image-guided neurosurgery. Navigation systems commonly used in neurosurgery suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) their accuracy degrades over the course of the operation and (2) they require the surgeon to mentally map images from the monitor to the patient. In this paper, we introduce the Intraoperative Brain Imaging System (IBIS), an open-source image-guided neurosurgery research platform that implements a novel workflow where navigation accuracy is improved using tracked intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) and the visualization of navigation information is facilitated through the use of augmented reality (AR). The IBIS platform allows a surgeon to capture tracked iUS images and use them to automatically update preoperative patient models and plans through fast GPU-based reconstruction and registration methods. Navigation, resection and iUS-based brain shift correction can all be performed using an AR view. IBIS has an intuitive graphical user interface for the calibration of a US probe, a surgical pointer as well as video devices used for AR (e.g., a surgical microscope). The components of IBIS have been validated in the laboratory and evaluated in the operating room. Image-to-patient registration accuracy is on the order of [Formula: see text] and can be improved with iUS to a median target registration error of 2.54 mm. The accuracy of the US probe calibration is between 0.49 and 0.82 mm. The average reprojection error of the AR system is [Formula: see text]. The system has been used in the operating room for various types of surgery, including brain tumor resection, vascular neurosurgery, spine surgery and DBS electrode implantation. The IBIS platform is a validated system that allows researchers to quickly bring the results of their work into the operating room for evaluation. It is the first open-source navigation system to provide a complete solution for AR visualization.
27589724	no cancer	-1	0	The piggyBac-Based Gene Delivery System Can Confer Successful Production of Cloned Porcine Blastocysts with Multigene Constructs. The introduction of multigene constructs into single cells is important for improving the performance of domestic animals, as well as understanding basic biological processes. In particular, multigene constructs allow the engineering and integration of multiple genes related to xenotransplantation into the porcine genome. The piggyBac (PB) transposon system allows multiple genes to be stably integrated into target genomes through a single transfection event. However, to our knowledge, no attempt to introduce multiple genes into a porcine genome has been made using this system. In this study, we simultaneously introduced seven transposons into a single porcine embryonic fibroblast (PEF). PEFs were transfected with seven transposons containing genes for five drug resistance proteins and two (red and green) fluorescent proteins, together with a PB transposase expression vector, pTrans (experimental group). The above seven transposons (without pTrans) were transfected concomitantly (control group). Selection of these transfected cells in the presence of multiple selection drugs resulted in the survival of several clones derived from the experimental group, but not from the control. PCR analysis demonstrated that approximately 90% (12/13 tested) of the surviving clones possessed all of the introduced transposons. Splinkerette PCR demonstrated that the transposons were inserted through the TTAA target sites of PB. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using a PEF clone with multigene constructs demonstrated successful production of cloned blastocysts expressing both red and green fluorescence. These results indicate the feasibility of this PB-mediated method for simultaneous transfer of multigene constructs into the porcine cell genome, which is useful for production of cloned transgenic pigs expressing multiple transgenes.

This study is aimed at seeking a nature saponin-based stabilizer for drug nanosuspensions. A poorly soluble drug (baicalein, BCL) was used as a model drug. BCL nanosuspensions with particle size of 156 nm were prepared by means of homogenization and converted into BCL nanocrystals (BCL-NC) stabilized with panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). It was found that PNS was able to prevent the aggregation of BCL-NS during storage and improve the redispersibility of BCL-NC after freeze-drying and spray-drying, compared with polymer stabilizer PVPK30. The freeze-dried and spray-dried BCL-NC with PNS exhibited excellent performance as evidenced by scanning_electron_microscope (SEM) analysis. It was the reason that PNS possessed the interfacial property (41.69 ± 0.32 mN/m) and electrostatic effect (-40.1 ± 1.6 mV), which could easily adsorb onto the surface of hydrophobic BCL nanocrystals and prevent from its aggregation. It is concluded that PNS can be used as an effective nature stabilizer for production of drug nanocrystals.
27588729	no cancer	-1	0	The clinical relevance of birch pollen profilin cross reactivity in sensitized patients. Overlapping seasons and cross reactivity, especially to grass pollen profilin, can hamper the diagnosis of birch pollen allergy. To identify the primary sensitizing allergen and the clinical relevance of cross sensitization, we correlated sensitization profiles with in vitro and in vivo tests, symptom scores and pollen counts. 433 patients with positive skin prick test (SPT) to birch pollen were analyzed regarding IgE to major birch and grass pollen allergens Bet v 1 and Phl p 1/p 5 and the profilins Bet v 2 and Phl p 12. Subgroups were analyzed by basophil activation test (BAT) and CAP-FEIA based cross- and self-inhibition tests. 349 patients were sensitized to Bet v 1, 44 to both Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 and 15 patients to Bet v 2 only. From Bet v 2 sensitized patients 40 were also sensitized to Phl p 12. Ex vivo, Bet v 2 and Phl p 12 induced dose dependent activation in basophils of these patients. Cross- and self-inhibition tests with both allergens confirmed cross reactivity. However, semi-quantitative analysis of SPTs demonstrated markedly increased reactivity to grass compared to birch pollen extract in Bet v 2 only sensitized patients. Accordingly, in most of those patients clinical symptoms precisely correlated with grass pollen counts. Identification of the clinically relevant and sensitizing allergen needs correlation of actual pollen counts with clinical symptoms and sensitization status to major allergens. Semi-quantitative analysis of SPT or BAT and determining profilin-specific IgE can contribute to making the diagnosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
27603788	no cancer	-1	0	Vascular Tumor Burden as a New Quantitative CT Biomarker for Predicting Metastatic RCC Response to Antiangiogenic Therapy. Purpose To quantify initial changes in the vascular tumor burden (VTB), a measure of the area of vascularized tumor on computed tomographic (CT) images, and predict tumor response to antiangiogenic therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Materials and Methods For this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant secondary analysis of a prospective phase III trial, adult patients with digital CT images and metastatic clear-cell RCC treated with sunitinib were included (n = 275). Target lesions were selected by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines, and the CT images obtained after one cycle of sunitinib therapy were evaluated in comparison with baseline images. Tumor-response software was created to quantify tumor metrics (length, area, VTB, and mean attenuation) and automate response assessment. Progression-free survival (PFS) in responders and nonresponders according to VTB criteria was compared by using the Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess interobserver agreement among three readers evaluating 28 randomly selected patients. Results VTB criteria nonresponders (n = 120) according to the initial posttherapy CT study were 5.7 times more likely to experience progression of disease (HR = 5.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.07, 7.97; P < .001) than responders (n = 155). There was not a statistically significant difference in PFS between RECIST nonresponders (n = 255) and responders (n = 20; HR = 1.54; 95% CI: 0.85, 2.77; P = .148). In a patient-level analysis, interobserver agreement was very good for assessing percentage change in length, area, and VTB (ICC = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.91], 0.89 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.94], and 0.88 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.94], respectively) but was very poor for assessing percentage change in mean attenuation (ICC = 0.17 [95% CI: -0.05, 0.45]). Conclusion A quantitative CT imaging biomarker designed to measure initial changes in the VTB separated patients into responders and nonresponders, each with significantly different PFS, and showed very good interobserver agreement in patients with metastatic RCC treated with sunitinib.

Due to its longer alcoxyl groups in the side chain, PFP polymer possesses good solubility in common organic solvents. Accordingly, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) from PFP polymer were easily prepared by a re-precipitation method. A spherical structure of the CPNs with an average diameter of ~75nm was verified by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The CPNs exhibit high photostability, good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. Based on these excellent properties, the CPNs as staining and labeling regents were used to cell imaging and located in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the fluorescent probe based on CPNs displays high selectivity and sensitivity for Fe(III) in water because of the aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching action between CPNs and Fe(III). The contribution of the report lies in providing a new strategy for designing and developing CPNs-based probes, and applying in the interdisciplinary fields of chemistry, biology and material sciences.
27579165	no cancer	-1	0	Skeletal implications and management of cystinosis: three case reports and literature review. Hypophosphatemic rickets and short stature are observed in nephropathic cystinosis, an orphan autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease due to a deficiency of cystinosin (CTNS gene). Although bone impairment is not common, it nevertheless appears to be more and more discussed by experts, even though the exact underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Four hypotheses are currently discussed to explain such impairment: copper deficiency, bone consequences of severe hypophosphatemic rickets during infancy, cysteamine toxicity and abnormal thyroid metabolism. In murine models, the invalidation of the CTNS gene is associated neither with renal phosphate wasting nor with renal failure, but causes severe osteopenia and growth retardation, thus raising the hypothesis of a specific underlying bone defect in cystinosis. Moreover, the in vitro ability of mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from bone marrow to differentiate along the osteoblastic lineage is reduced in patients with cystinosis as compared with cells obtained from healthy controls, this cellular abnormality being reverted after cysteamine treatment. From our experience of three pediatric patients with cystinosis and severe bone deformations having undergone a thorough biochemical evaluation, as well as a bone biopsy, we conclude that even though copper deficiency, high-doses cysteamine regimens and abnormal thyroid metabolism may worsen the bone picture in cystinosis patients, the exact pathophysiology of such impairment remains to be defined. The role of chronic hypoparathyroidism due to chronic phosphate wasting could also be discussed. In the future, larger and prospective studies should focus on this topic because of the potential major impact on patients' quality of life.
27577425	no cancer	-1	0	A Dynamic Approach to Support Interoperability for Medical Reports Using DICOM SR. The standardization of data structures for clinical observations in medical imaging environments is a relatively recent effort. DICOM standard defines a set of supplements for different medical reports denominated as Structured Reports (SR). In 2013, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) also followed this trend by publishing the profile Management of Radiology Report Templates (MRRT). However, the generalized adoption of these normalized reports has been delayed due to several factors. In fact, numerous medical institutions still use proprietary formats that do not promote sharing and remote access. New strategies to incentivise the adoption of normalized report templates are needed to make them interoperable between distinct applications. This article proposes a new method to automatically generate DICOM SR from distinct data sources. It encompasses a flexible mapping schema that can be used with distinct medical imaging modalities. Our ultimate goal is to encourage the usage of DICOM SR by providing an effortless method to convert proprietary formats into standard ones. Moreover, the developed methods can be also used for supporting IHE MRRT profiles, making the reports accessible across different information systems and institutions.
27592695	no cancer	-1	0	MiR-125b Regulates SFRP5 Expression to Promote Growth and Activation of Cardiac Fibroblasts. Myocardial fibrosis (MF), which typically occurs after a myocardial infarction (MI), is a major factor involved in the process of ventricular remodeling and subsequent progression to heart failure. Current studies have found that various microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-125b, play an important role in this process. However, few studies have investigated the specific mechanism of miR-125b. Transfection of miR-125b mimics into cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) resulted in significantly increased expression of the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vinculin by western blot analysis, while transfection of miR-125b inhibitors resulted in the opposite effect. Analysis of putative CF target genes for miR-125b revealed that miR-125b specifically inhibits expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5). SFRP5 inhibited expression of α-SMA and collagen I and III in CFs, while miR-125b promoted the expression of these proteins. Cotransfection of the SFRP5 overexpression vector and miR-125b mimics did not result in significant upregulation of SFRP5 expression or downregulation of α-SMA and collagen I and III. Further analysis revealed that miR-125b promotes the proliferation and migration of CFs and inhibits their apoptosis, while SFRP5 exhibits the opposite effects. These results indicate that miR-125b can regulate SFRP5 expression and thus influence the growth and activation of CFs. Hence, this study provides important insight into possible approaches for the prevention and treatment of MF after an MI.
27595183	no cancer	-1	0	Cost-effectiveness of initial antiretroviral treatment administered as single vs. multiple tablet regimens with the same or different components. To evaluate the efficiency of single-tablet regimens (STR) and multiple-tablet regimens (MTR) with exactly the same or different components. A study was conducted on HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naïve patients from 6 Spanish or French centers, who were started on treatment with STR-Atripla(®), or the same components separately (MTR-SC), or a different MTR (MTR-Other). Effectiveness was measured as percentage of HIV-RNA <50copies/mL at 48 weeks (ITT). Efficiency was the ratio between costs (direct cost of antiretrovirals plus outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and resistance tests) and effectiveness. The study included a total of 2773 patients (759 STR-Atripla(®), 483 MTR-SC, and 1531 MTR-Other). Median age was 37 years, 15% were HCV co-infected, 27% had a CD4+ count <200cells/μL, and 30% had viral load ≥100.000copies/mL. The duration of the assigned treatment was longer for STR-Atripla(®) (P<.0001). Response rates (adjusted for CD4+ count, viral load, and clustered on hospitals) at 48 weeks were 76%, 74%, and 62%, respectively (P<.0001). Virological failure was more common in MTR patients (P=.0025), and interruptions due to intolerance with MTR-Other (P<.0001). Cost per responder at 48 weeks (efficiency) was €12,406 with STR-Atripla(®), €11,034 with MTR-SC (0.89 [0.82, 0.99] times lower), and €18,353 (1.48 [1.38, 1.61] times higher) with MTR-Other. STR-Atripla(®) and MTR-SC regimens showed similar effectiveness, but virological failure rate was lower with STR-Atripla. MTR-SC, considered less convenient, had a marginally better efficiency, mainly due to lower direct costs. MTR-Other regimens had both a worse effectiveness and efficiency. Similar efficiency analyses adjusting for baseline characteristics should be recommended for new STRs.

This underscores the need for households and healthcare providers to understand the concept of newborn care and react appropriately and timely too. To determine the knowledge and practices of mothers in the Elele community regarding neonatal care. This was a community-based descriptive cross sectional study of 380 mothers who had a neonate. Mothers were selected using a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected by interview using a semi-structured questionnaire (with closed and open ended questions) and analyzed using a statistical package for social sciences version 22.0. Chi-square test was used to identify statistically significant associations among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendance cum place of delivery and neonatal care practices. Ninety one (23.9%) of respondents were aware of at least four out of nine danger signs, while all reported wrapping their babies within 10 minutes after birth. Duration less than six hours from birth to first bath, feeding with or discarding of colostrum and timing of first breastfeeding within the first hour of birth were significantly associated with ANC attendance (p = 0.000, p = 0.002 and p = 0.000 respectively). Duration less than six hours to first bath, umbilical cord care and feeding with or discarding of colostrum were significantly associated with health facility delivery (p = 0.043, p = 0.026 and p = 0.003 respectively). Inadequate knowledge of newborn care among mothers was found, while non-ANC attendance and non-health facility delivery were associated with inappropriate neonatal care practices. We recommend comprehensive behavior change interventions, to promote proper neonatal care practices.
27582318	no cancer	-1	0	Location and Visualization of Working p-n and/or n-p Junctions by XPS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to follow some of the electrical properties of a segmented silicon photodetector, fabricated in a p-n-p configuration, during operation under various biasing configurations. Mapping of the binding energy position of Si2p reveals the shift in the position of the junctions with respect to the polarity of the DC bias applied. Use of squared and triangular shaped wave excitations, while recording XPS data, allows tapping different electrical properties of the device under normal operational conditions, as well as after exposing parts of it to harsh physical and chemical treatments. Unique and chemically specific electrical information can be gained with this noninvasive approach which can be useful especially for localized device characterization and failure analyses.
27598115	no cancer	-1	0	(13)C-NMR-Based Metabolomic Profiling of Typical Asian Soy Sauces. It has been a strong consumer interest to choose high quality food products with clear information about their origin and composition. In the present study, a total of 22 Asian soy sauce samples have been analyzed in terms of (13)C-NMR spectroscopy. Spectral data were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods in order to find out the important metabolites causing the discrimination among typical soy sauces from different Asian regions. It was found that significantly higher concentrations of glutamate in Chinese red cooking (CR) soy sauce may be the result of the manual addition of monosodium glutamate (MSG) in the final soy sauce product. Whereas lower concentrations of amino acids, like leucine, isoleucine and valine, observed in CR indicate the different fermentation period used in production of CR soy sauce, on the other hand, the concentration of some fermentation cycle metabolites, such as acetate and sucrose, can be divided into two groups. The concentrations of these fermentation cycle metabolites were lower in CR and Singapore Kikkoman (SK), whereas much higher in Japanese shoyu (JS) and Taiwan (China) light (TL), which depict the influence of climatic conditions. Therefore, the results of our study directly indicate the influences of traditional ways of fermentation, climatic conditions and the selection of raw materials and can be helpful for consumers to choose their desired soy sauce products, as well as for researchers in further authentication studies about soy sauce.
27589506	no cancer	-1	0	Rapid stepping test towards virtual visual objects: Feasibility and convergent validity in older adults. Rapid voluntary stepping has been recognized as an important measure of balance control. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and convergent validity of a Rapid Stepping Test protocol utilizing a virtual reality SeeMeTM system (VR-RST) in elderly ambulatory and independent individuals living in a community residential home. Associations between step execution times determined by the system and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Questionnaire, and clinical measures of balance performance in the MiniBESTest and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, were established in 60 participants (mean age 88.2 + 5.0 years). All participants completed the study. The correlations of the ABC questionnaire and the clinical tests with VR-RST forward and backward stepping were moderate (ρ rage 0.42-0.52), and weak to moderate with sideward stepping (ρ rage 0.32-0.52). Moderate to strong correlations were found across stepping directions (ρ rage 0.45-0.87). Findings support the test's feasibility and validity and confirm the utility of the VR-RST as an assessment tool in an elderly population.
27579031	no cancer	-1	0	Using SVD on Clusters to Improve Precision of Interdocument Similarity Measure. Recently, LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) based on SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is proposed to overcome the problems of polysemy and homonym in traditional lexical matching. However, it is usually criticized as with low discriminative power for representing documents although it has been validated as with good representative quality. In this paper, SVD on clusters is proposed to improve the discriminative power of LSI. The contribution of this paper is three manifolds. Firstly, we make a survey of existing linear algebra methods for LSI, including both SVD based methods and non-SVD based methods. Secondly, we propose SVD on clusters for LSI and theoretically explain that dimension expansion of document vectors and dimension projection using SVD are the two manipulations involved in SVD on clusters. Moreover, we develop updating processes to fold in new documents and terms in a decomposed matrix by SVD on clusters. Thirdly, two corpora, a Chinese corpus and an English corpus, are used to evaluate the performances of the proposed methods. Experiments demonstrate that, to some extent, SVD on clusters can improve the precision of interdocument similarity measure in comparison with other SVD based LSI methods.
27600155	no cancer	-1	0	SPACE - A randomized study of SBRT vs conventional fractionated radiotherapy in medically inoperable stage I NSCLC. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been introduced for small lung tumors due to excellent local control and few side effects, even though there are no comparative studies. SPACE (Stereotactic Precision And Conventional radiotherapy Evaluation) is the first randomized phase II trial comparing SBRT and conventional fractionated radiotherapy (3DCRT). Patients with stage I medically inoperable NSCLC were randomized to receive SBRT to 66Gy in 3 fractions (one week) or 3DCRT to 70Gy (7weeks). Patients were followed to assess efficacy, toxicity and HRQL. Between 2007 and 2011, 102 patients were randomized. Mean age 74 (57-86), 60% women, the vast majority (92%) had COPD or cardiovascular comorbidity. The SBRT arm included more patients with T2-tumors (p=0.02) and male gender (p=0.35). The median follow-up was 37months with a 1-, 2- and 3-year PFS of: SBRT: 76%, 53%, 42% and 3DCRT: 87%, 54% 42%, HR=0.85 (95% CI 0.52-1.36) with no difference between the groups and no difference in OS (HR=0.75, 95% CI 0.43-1.30). At the end of the study 70% of SBRT patients had not progressed compared to 59% (3DCRT, p=0.26). Toxicity was low with no grade 5 events. Pneumonitis of any grade was observed in 19% (SBRT) and 34% (3DCRT, p=0.26), and esophagitis in 8% and 30% respectively (p=0.006). HRQL was evaluated with the EORTC QLQ 30 and LC14 module and patients treated with 3DCRT experienced worse dyspnea (p=0.01), chest pain (p=0.02) and cough (>10 points difference). There was no difference in PFS and OS between SBRT and conventionally treated patients despite an imbalance of prognostic factors. We observed a tendency of an improved disease control rate in the SBRT group and they experienced better HRQL and less toxicity. SBRT is convenient for patients and should be considered standard treatment for patients with inoperable stage I NSCLC.
27593714	no cancer	-1	0	Patient BMI is an Independent Predictor of 30-Day Hospital Readmission after Elective Spine Surgery. Hospital readmission within 30-days of index surgery is receiving increased scrutiny as an indicator of poor quality of care. Accordingly, reducing readmissions achieves the dual benefit of improving quality and reducing costs. With the growing prevalence of obesity, understanding its impact on 30-day unplanned readmissions and patients' perception of health status is important for appropriate risk stratification of patients. The aim of this study is to determine if obesity is an independent risk factor for unplanned 30-day readmissions following elective spine surgery. The medical records of 500 patients (Non-obese: n=281, Obese: n=219) undergoing elective spine surgery at a major academic medical center were reviewed. Pre-operative BMI was measured on all patients. BMI that was equal to or greater than 30 kg/m(2) was classified as obese. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and post-operative complication rates were collected. The primary outcome investigated in this study was unplanned all-cause 30-day hospital readmission. The association between pre-operative obesity and 30-day readmission rate was assessed via multivariate logistic regression analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar between both cohorts, Table 1. Operative variables and complication profiles were similar between both cohorts, Table 1. Overall, 8.6% of patients were re-admitted within 30-days of discharge, with obese patients experiencing a 2-fold increase in 30-day readmission rates (Obese: 12.33% vs. Non-obese: 5.69%, p=0.01), Table 1. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, preoperative obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) was found to be an independent predictor of 30-day readmission after elective spine surgery (p=0.001), Table 2. Pre-operative obesity is an independent risk factor for readmission within 30-days of discharge after elective spine surgery. In a cost-conscious healthcare climate, pre-operative BMI can identify patients at risk for early-unplanned hospital readmission.
27585472	no cancer	-1	0	Prediction of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficient for SAMPL5 drug-like compounds with the QMPFF3 and ARROW polarizable force fields. We present the performance of blind predictions of water-cyclohexane distribution coefficients for 53 drug-like compounds in the SAMPL5 challenge by three methods currently in use within our group. Two of them utilize QMPFF3 and ARROW, polarizable force-fields of varying complexity, and the third uses the General Amber Force-Field (GAFF). The polarizable FF's are implemented in an in-house MD package, Arbalest. We find that when we had time to parametrize the functional groups with care (batch 0), the polarizable force-fields outperformed the non-polarizable one. Conversely, on the full set of 53 compounds, GAFF performed better than both QMPFF3 and ARROW. We also describe the torsion-restrain method we used to improve sampling of molecular conformational space and thus the overall accuracy of prediction. The SAMPL5 challenge highlighted several drawbacks of our force-fields, such as our significant systematic over-estimation of hydrophobic interactions, specifically for alkanes and aromatic rings.
27601661	no cancer	-1	0	Whole-exome sequencing identifies recurrent AKT1 mutations in sclerosing hemangioma of lung. Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (PSH) is a benign tumor with two cell populations (epithelial and stromal cells), for which genomic profiles remain unknown. We conducted exome sequencing of 44 PSHs and identified recurrent somatic mutations of AKT1 (43.2%) and β-catenin (4.5%). We used a second subset of 24 PSHs to confirm the high frequency of AKT1 mutations (overall 31/68, 45.6%; p.E17K, 33.8%) and recurrent β-catenin mutations (overall 3 of 68, 4.4%). Of the PSHs without AKT1 mutations, two exhibited AKT1 copy gain. AKT1 mutations existed in both epithelial and stromal cells. In two separate PSHs from one patient, we observed two different AKT1 mutations, indicating they were not disseminated but independent arising tumors. Because the AKT1 mutations were not found to co-occur with β-catenin mutations (or any other known driver alterations) in any of the PSHs studied, we speculate that this may be the single-most common driver alteration to develop PSHs. Our study revealed genomic differences between PSHs and lung adenocarcinomas, including a high rate of AKT1 mutation in PSHs. These genomic features of PSH identified in the present study provide clues to understanding the biology of PSH and for differential genomic diagnosis of lung tumors.
27591799	no cancer	-1	0	CADASIL: Imaging Characteristics and Clinical Correlation. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene located on chromosome 19p13. CADASIL causes a clinical syndrome of migraines (frequently with aura), progressive strokes, and cognitive decline in adults leading to severe functional impairment by the seventh decade of life. Genetic testing is the gold standard for diagnosing this condition, but the syndrome can be suspected clinically based on history and a characteristic pattern of confluent subcortical white matter disease in the anterior temporal poles and external capsule. Additional abnormalities include cerebral microbleeds and large vessel stenosis, particularly in Asian populations. Familiarity with radiologic findings in CADASIL is essential to the correct diagnosis and subsequent management of this disease.

The thickness of corneal pachymetry and the epithelium after accelerated (45 mW/cm(2)) transepithelial corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) for keratoconus were assessed in this prospective case series study. Twenty-eight patients were treated for keratoconus. The mean Kmax was 56.18 ± 7.90. The thinnest point, as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), was 443.18 ± 39.75 μm. Accelerated transepithelial CXL was performed, and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), corneal topography, and OCT were recorded at 1 week postoperatively as well as at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The surgery was uneventful in all eyes. Postoperative epithelial edema was observed and faded in 3 days. The postoperative Kmax was 54.56 ± 8.81, 55.78 ± 8.11, 56.37 ± 8.71, 55.80 ± 7.92, and 55.47 ± 8.24 at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, respectively (all, P > 0.05). The thinnest postoperative corneal point, 439.04 ± 44.99 μm, was observed at 12 months (P = 0.109). The epithelial thickness decreased during the first postoperative week then showed a gradual recovery. Postoperative pachymetry thickness showed no significant changes for up to 12 months. Postoperative epithelial thickness decreased temporarily, then stabilized at month 12. Accelerated transepithelial CXL was shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of keratoconus.
27592141	no cancer	-1	0	Morphology of drying blood pools. Often blood pools are found on crime scenes which may provide information concerning the events that took place on the scene. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the drying dynamics of blood pools. This study focuses on the drying process of blood pools to determine what relevant information can be obtained for the forensic application. We recorded the drying process of blood pools with a camera while measuring the mass. We found that the drying process can be separated into five different stages: coagulation, gelation, rim desiccation, centre desiccation, and final desiccation. Moreover, by normalizing the mass and drying time we show that the mass of the blood pools diminish similarly and in a reproducible way for blood pools created under various conditions. In addition, we verify that the size of the blood pools is directly related to its volume and the wettability of the surface. Our study clearly shows that blood pools dry in a reproducible fashion. This preliminary work highlights the difficult task that represents blood pool analysis in forensic investigations, and how internal and external parameters influence its dynamics. We conclude that understanding the drying process dynamics would be advancement in time line reconstitution of events.

It was demonstrated that second- and third-trimester therapeutic termination of pregnancy (TOP) is feasible in cases with placenta previa. We report a 34-year-old woman with complex fetal malformations associated with placenta previa. An ultrasound examination at 21 weeks of gestation revealed fetal growth restriction (FGR) and complex fetal malformations associated with a placenta previa. After extensive information, the parents opted for careful observation. Thereafter, FGR gradually progressed and we observed arrest of end-diastolic velocity of the umbilical artery. Finally, intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) was confirmed at 33 weeks of gestation. Two days after IUFD, the patient experienced labor pain. The placenta and dead fetus weighing 961 g were vaginally delivered, and total bleeding was 270 mL. Although further studies to confirm the dynamic change of the uteroplacental blood flow are necessary to avoid the risk of maternal hemorrhage, vaginal TOP with placenta previa after feticide or IUFD would be feasible.
27591274	no cancer	-1	0	Effect of production system and flock age on eggshell and egg internal quality measurements. Egg quality was measured in eggs from different flocks that were reared together and then allocated to different production systems. Eggs were processed for measurements of eggshell and egg internal quality variables, scoring of ultrastructural mammillary layer features, completeness of cuticle cover, and protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) quantification. There was a significant main effect (P < 0.05) of production system on shell reflectivity, egg weight, and egg internal quality and significant effects of flock age on most measurements. The mammillary layer ultrastructural variables showed no clear relationship with production system and flock age. However, there was a significant interaction between production system and flock age for mammillary cap, early and late fusions. Cuticle cover ([Formula: see text]), was significantly higher in barn eggs (19.20), followed by free range (17.57), and cage eggs (15.99). Completeness of cuticle cover was significantly higher in eggs from the 44 week old flock than for 64 week and 73 week old flocks. For eggshells with cuticle intact, there was a significant main effect of both production system and flock age, and significant interaction between the two, for shell reflectivity, L*a*b* values and amount of PP IX. For PP IX, when this difference was calculated for the cuticle alone, there were no statistically significant differences. In 1 g of shell with and without cuticle, there was more PP IX in cage eggs (9.49 × 10(-8), 7.90 × 10(-8) mM) followed by free range (8.24 × 10(-8), 6.90 × 10(-8) mM), and barn eggs (8.64 × 10(-8), 7.28 × 10(-8) mM). Similar trends were recorded for the amount of PP IX in 1 g of cuticle, but the difference was not statistically significant. The amount of PP IX decreased significantly with increasing flock age. Comparing the cage and barn production systems at 68 week of flock age, there was no difference for the amount of PP IX in shell with or without cuticle, or in the cuticle alone. Eggs from the cage production system were darker in color and contained more PP IX mainly within the calcareous part of the shell. For the barn production system, the completeness of cuticle cover was higher and egg weight generally lower.
27579455	no cancer	-1	0	Age-related variations in corneal biomechanical properties. To determine age-related changes in corneal viscoelastic properties in healthy individuals. This observational cross-sectional study was performed at the Department of Ophthalmology, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran and included 302 healthy individuals in 6 age decades (range: 10-69 years). After complete ocular examination, corneal viscoelastic properties were measured by ocular response analyzer and central corneal thickness (CCT) by an ultrasonic pachymeter. Our main outcome measures were corneal viscoelastic properties in different age groups. Corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) showed a significant negative correlation with age (P < 0.001 for both, r = -0.353 and r = -0.246, respectively). Female gender had significantly higher CH (P = 0.017) and CRF (P = 0.019). CH and CRF were significantly correlated (P < 0.001, r = 0.821). CCT showed a biphasic pattern with significantly higher thicknesses before 20 and after 50 years of age. CH and CRF were significantly correlated with CCT (P < 0.001 for both, r = 0.21 and r = 0.26, respectively) and intraocular pressure (IOP) (P < 0.001 for both, r = -0.474 and r = 0.598, respectively). Corneal-compensated IOP (IOPcc) was significantly higher after age 40 compared to age group <20 (p < 0.045). Goldmann-correlated IOP (IOPg) was significantly correlated with CCT (P = 0.001, r = 0.193), while IOPcc showed no correlation with CCT (P = 0.265, r = 0.062). CH was significantly higher in hyperopic eyes compared to emmetropic eyes (P = 0.009) and myopic eye (P < 0.001). In this study, there was a decrease in CH and CRF with an increase in age. Hyperopia and female gender are associated with higher CH and CRF. CCT is higher toward the extremes of life and is significantly correlated with CH and CRF.

Evidence from various consortia on vascular contributions has been inconsistent in determining the etiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular pathologies associated in manifestation of AD-related neuropathological changes of an elderly population. Postmortem brain samples from 76 elderly subjects (≥50 years) were used to study genetic polymorphisms, intracranial atherosclerosis of the circle of Willis (IASCW), and microscopic infarcts in deep white matters. From this cohort, 50 brains (≥60 years) were subjected to neuropathological diagnosis using immunohistopathological techniques. Besides the association with age, the apolipoproteinE ɛ4 allele was significantly and strongly associated with Thal amyloid-β phases ≥1 [odds ratio (OR) = 6.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-33.45] and inversely with Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages ≥III (0.02, 0.0-0.47). Illiterates showed a significant positive association for Braak NFT stages ≥IV (14.62, 1.21-176.73) and a significant negative association for microscopic infarcts (0.15, 0.03-0.71) in deep white matters. With respect to cerebrovascular pathologies, cerebral small vessel lesions (white matter hyperintensities and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) showed a higher degree of associations among them and with AD-related neuropathological changes (p < 0.05) compared to large vessel pathology (IASCW), which showed a significant association only with Braak NFT stages ≥I (p = 0.050). These findings suggest that besides age, education, and genetic factors, other vascular risk factors were not associated with AD-related neuropathological changes and urge prompt actions be taken against cerebral small vessel diseases since evidence for effective prevention is still lacking.

Policy makers should aim to minimize the delay in the adoption of new breakpoints for antimicrobials for emerging pathogens where containment of spread is paramount, with delays under 1.5 years being ideal.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of distress screening implementation in Japanese designated cancer hospitals. This was a cross-sectional observational study. Palliative care team representatives in all designated cancer hospitals in Japan completed an ad hoc questionnaire. Demographic data in 2014 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. Of 422 institutions, 389 responded (92%) and data were obtained from 379 (90%). Approximately 90% of institutions had implemented a distress screening program at some level, and approximately 60% had just started screening. Among those institutions that screened, 77% provided individualized triage to specialized services within the institutions, whereas 60% did not routinely follow-up with patients who had positive screening results. The estimated median percentage of screened patients referred to palliative care teams was 0.4% in outpatient settings and 6.3% in inpatient settings. Although 68% of respondents perceived that screening was useful overall, they also reported difficulties when conducting screening with patients, reporting ""no established effective treatment for problems screened"" (66%), ""patients complain it is difficult to express their distress using scales"" (58%), and that it was ""difficult to manage screened problems because of lack of time"" (49%). Eight perceived barriers to implementing distress screening programs in hospitals were identified; a lack of human resources ranked highest. Implementation of distress screening in designated cancer hospitals in Japan has just begun. Policymakers should acknowledge that screening can be beneficial for patients when it is implemented with appropriate resources and established methods."

While previous studies have improved our understanding of how, when and why houses are destroyed by wildfires, little attention has been given to how these fires started. We compiled a dataset of wildfires that destroyed houses in New South Wales and Victoria and, by comparing against wildfires where no houses were destroyed, investigated the relationship between the distribution of ignition causes for wildfires that did and did not destroy houses. Powerlines, lightning and deliberate ignitions are the main causes of wildfires that destroyed houses. Powerlines were 6 times more common in the wildfires that destroyed houses data than in the wildfires where no houses were destroyed data and lightning was 2 times more common. For deliberate- and powerline-caused wildfires, temperature, wind speed, and forest fire danger index were all significantly higher and relative humidity significantly lower (P < 0.05) on the day of ignition for wildfires that destroyed houses compared with wildfires where no houses were destroyed. For all powerline-caused wildfires the first house destroyed always occurred on the day of ignition. In contrast, the first house destroyed was after the day of ignition for 78% of lightning-caused wildfires. Lightning-caused wildfires that destroyed houses were significantly larger (P < 0.001) in area than human-caused wildfires that destroyed houses. Our results suggest that targeting fire prevention strategies around ignition causes, such as improving powerline safety and targeted arson reduction programmes, and reducing fire spread may decrease the number of wildfires that destroy houses.
27751847	respiratory system cancer	50615	1	Osimertinib for pretreated EGFR Thr790Met-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (AURA2): a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor selective for EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor sensitising mutations, and the EGFR Thr790Met resistance mutation. We assessed the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in patients with EGFR Thr790Met-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who had progressed after previous therapy with an approved EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. In this phase 2, open-label, single-arm study (AURA2), patients aged at least 18 years with centrally confirmed EGFR Thr790Met-positive mutations, locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC who progressed on previous EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy received osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily; treatment could continue beyond progression if the investigator observed a clinical benefit. Patients with asymptomatic, stable CNS metastases not requiring steroids were allowed to enrol. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by blinded independent central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Response endpoints were assessed in the evaluable for response analysis set (ie, all patients who received at least one dose of osimertinib and had measurable disease at baseline according to blinded independent central review). Other endpoints and safety were assessed in all patients receiving at least one osimertinib dose (full analysis set). The study is ongoing and patients are still receiving treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02094261. Between May 20, 2014, and Sept 12, 2014, 472 patients were screened, of whom 210 started osimertinib treatment between June 13, 2014, and Oct 27, 2014; 11 patients were excluded from the evaluable for response analysis set (n=199) due to absence of measurable disease at baseline by blinded independent central review. At data cutoff (Nov 1, 2015), 122 (58%) patients remained on treatment. The median duration of follow-up was 13·0 months (IQR 7·6-14·2). 140 (70%; 95% CI 64-77) of 199 patients achieved an objective response by blinded independent central review: confirmed complete responses were achieved in six (3%) patients and partial responses were achieved in 134 (67%) patients. The most common all-causality grade 3 and 4 adverse events were pulmonary embolism (seven [3%]), prolonged electrocardiogram QT (five [2%]), decreased neutrophil count (four [2%]), anaemia, dyspnoea, hyponatraemia, increased alanine aminotransferase, and thrombocytopenia (three [1%] each). Serious adverse events were reported in 52 (25%) patients, of which 11 (5%) were investigator assessed as possibly treatment-related to osimertinib. Seven deaths were due to adverse events; these were pneumonia (n=2), pneumonia aspiration (n=1), rectal haemorrhage (n=1), dyspnoea (n=1), failure to thrive (n=1), and interstitial lung disease (n=1). The only fatal event assessed as possibly treatment-related by the investigator was due to interstitial lung disease. Osimertinib showed clinical activity with manageable side-effects in patients with EGFR Thr790Met-positive NSCLC. Therefore, osimertinib could be a suitable treatment for patients with EGFR Thr790Met-positive disease who have progressed on an EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. AstraZeneca.
27601367	no cancer	-1	0	Neonatal Arterial Morphology Is Related to Body Size in Abnormal Human Fetal Growth. Restriction in fetal growth is associated with cardiovascular disease in adulthood. It is unclear whether abnormal intrauterine growth influences arterial morphology during the fetal or neonatal stage. The objective was to study the regional arterial morphology with respect to gestational age and abnormal fetal body size. We studied body anthropometrics and arterial morphology and physiology in 174 neonates born between 31 and 42 weeks of gestation, including neonates with birth weights appropriate, small, and large for age, with very high resolution vascular ultrasound (35-55 MHz). In simple linear regressions, parameters of body size (body weight, body surface area, and organ circumference) and gestational age were statistically significantly associated with common carotid, brachial, femoral arterial parameters (lumen diameter [LD], wall layer thickness [intima-media thickness and intima-media-adventitia thickness], and carotid artery wall stress [CAWS]). Male sex was statistically significantly associated with LD and CAWS. In multiple linear regression models, body size, gestational age, and sex explained a large proportion of the arterial variance (R( 2) range, 0.37-0.47 for LD; 0.09-0.35 for intima-media thickness; 0.21-0.41 for intima-media-adventitia thickness; and 0.23 for CAWS; all models P<0.001). Arterial wall layer thickness, LDs, and CAWS were independently and strongly predicted by body size, and no effect of maternal disease was observed when added to the models. Gestational age and male sex were also independently but more weakly associated with arterial LDs and CAWS (P<0.01), but not with arterial wall layers. These results indicate that the intrauterine growth of fetal arterial LD and wall layer thickness are primarily attributed to body growth overall. LD and CAWS show weaker association with gestational age and sex.

Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is a zoonosis in children, result of infection by Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative bacillus. Infection is generally characterized by regional and self-limited lymphadenopathy after exposure to a scratch or bite from a cat. Rarely, B. henselae is cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO), with dissemination to various organs, most often involving the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow), mimicking an inflammatory rather than a lymphoproliferative disease. Whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WBMRI), in association with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWIBS), allows a comprehensive evaluation of pediatric patients, without the risks inherent to ionizing radiation. It is a rapid and sensitive method for detecting and monitoring multifocal lesions such as proliferative or inflammatory and infectious processes. We report a case of systemic CDS in an immunocompetent young boy with fever of unknown origin, without history of cat contact, investigated by WBMRI.
27598516	no cancer	-1	0	Immunological effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy against brain tumors. The mainstays of brain tumor therapy are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy is explored as an additional treatment modality. However, emerging evidence indicates that also radio- and chemotherapy have immunological effects in addition to their cytotoxic and cytostatic activities. We summarize the literature on radio- and chemotherapy-mediated immunological effects in primary and secondary brain tumors and outline open questions within the field. To this end, a literature search was performed using the terms 'brain tumor', 'immune system', 'immunogenic cell death', 'vaccination', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'radiotherapy', 'chemotherapy' and derivations thereof. Expert commentary: Immunological effects of chemo- and radiotherapy in brain tumors involve direct immunogenic modulations of tumor cells, changes of the microenvironment and functional alterations of innate and adaptive immune cells. Each treatment modality can exert various effects that comprise both immune-stimulatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms. A detailed knowledge of these mechanisms is indispensable for an optimal combination of conventional anti-tumor treatments and novel immunotherapeutic approaches.

Although human biological indicators have been widely utilized for biomonitoring environmental pollutants in health exposure assessment, the relationship between internal and external exposure has not yet been adequately established. In this study, we collected and analyzed 61 rice, 56 pepper, and 58 soil samples, together with 107 hair, 107 blood, and 107 urine samples from residents living in selected intensive mining areas in China. Concentrations of most of the four elements considered (Pb, Cd, Hg, and Se) exceeded national standards, implying high exposure risk in the study areas. Regression analysis also revealed a correlation (0.33, P < 0.001) between the concentration of Pb in soil and that in human hair (as well as in human blood); to some extent, Pb content in hair and blood could therefore be used to characterize external Pb exposure. The correlation between Hg in rice and in human hair (up to 0.5, P < 0.001) further confirmed a significant indicative effect of human hair for Hg exposure. A significant correlation was also noted between concentrations of some elements in different human samples, for example, between Hg in hair and blood (0.641, P < 0.01) and between Cd in urine and blood (0.339, P < 0.01). To some extent, there could thus be mutual reflectance of the same heavy metal in different samples, with the possibility for complementary use in assessing heavy metal exposure.

Nitric oxide (NO), an important multifunctional signaling molecule, is produced by three isoforms of NO-synthase (NOS) and has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Selective inhibitors of the subtypes iNOS (inducible) or nNOS (neuronal) are of great interest for decoding neurodestructive key factors, and (18)F-labelled analogues would allow investigating the NOS-function by molecular imaging with positron emission tomography. Especially, the highly selective nNOS inhibitor 6-((3-((3-fluorophenethylamino)methyl)phenoxy)methyl)-4-methylpyridin-2-amine (10) lends itself as suitable compound to be (18)F-labelled in no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) form. For preparation of the (18)F-labelled nNOS-Inhibitor [(18)F]10 a ""build-up"" radiosynthesis was developed based on a corresponding iodonium ylide as labelling precursor. The such activated phenethyl group of the compound was efficiently and regioselectively labelled with n.c.a. [(18)F]fluoride in 79% radiochemical yield (RCY). After conversion by reductive amination and microwave assisted displacement of the protecting groups, the desired nNOS-inhibitor was obtained in about 15% total RCY. Alternatively, for a simplified ""late-stage"" (18)F-labelling procedure a corresponding boronic ester precursor was synthesized and successfully used in a newer, copper(II) mediated n.c.a. (18)F-fluoro-deboroniation reaction, achieving the same total RCY. Thus, both methods proved comparatively suited to provide the highly selective NOS-inhibitor [(18)F]10 as probe for preclinical in vivo studies."

The RPPE process can be very useful when evaluating health design. It is imperative for design and healthcare professionals to use the RPPE methods to gain factual knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes of how the built environment influences a respondent's life, health, and illness and be able to translate these findings into effective healthcare designs.
27602037	no cancer	-1	0	Characterizing Two Inter-specific Bin Maps for the Exploration of the QTLs/Genes that Confer Three Soybean Evolutionary Traits. Annual wild soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc.), the wild progenitor of the cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], is valuable for improving the later. The construction of a linkage map is crucial for studying the genetic differentiation between these species, but marker density is the main factor limiting the accuracy of such a map. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies allow for the generation of high-density linkage maps. Here, two sets of inter-specific recombinant inbred line populations, named NJIRNP and NJIR4P, composed of 284 and 161 lines, respectively, were generated from the same wild male parent, PI 342618B, and genotyped by restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing. Two linkage maps containing 5,728 and 4,354 bins were constructed based on 89,680 and 80,995 single nucleotide polymorphisms, spanning a total genetic distance of 2204.6 and 2136.7 cM, with an average distance of 0.4 and 0.5 cM between neighboring bins in NJRINP and NJRI4P, respectively. With the two maps, seven well-studied loci, B1 for seed bloom; G and I for seed coat color; E2, E3, qDTF16.1 and two linked FLOWERING LOCUS T for days to flowering, were detected. In addition, two SB and two DTF loci were newly identified in wild soybean. Using two high-density maps, the mapping resolution was enhanced, e.g., G was narrowed to a region of 0.4 Mb on chromosome 1, encompassing 54 gene models, among which only Glyma01g40590 was predicted to be involved in anthocyanin accumulation, and its interaction with I was verified in both populations. In addition, five genes, Glyma16g03030, orthologous to Arabidopsis Phytochrome A (PHYA); Glyma13g28810, Glyma13g29920, and Glyma13g30710 predicted to encode the APETALA 2 (AP2) domain; and Glyma02g00300, involved in response to red or far red light, might be candidate DTF genes. Our results demonstrate that RAD-seq is a cost-effective approach for constructing high-density and high-quality bin maps that can be used to map QTLs/genes into such small enough regions that their candidate genes can be predicted.
27586106	no cancer	-1	0	Driving under the influence of alcohol in professional drivers in Cameroon. Professional drivers play a pivotal role in transporting people and goods in Cameroon. Alcohol misuse is frequent in Cameroon, but its impact on professional drivers has never been studied. This study assessed driving under the influence of alcohol and its correlates in professional drivers in Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was conducted at 4 sites on the Yaoundé-Douala highway during a 10-day period in 2014. At each site, professional drivers were randomly stopped during a 24-h window and their breath was sampled for alcohol use. The prevalence of driving under the influence (the equivalent of blood alcohol level ≥ 1 mg/100 mL) and impaired driving (blood alcohol level ≥ 40 mg/100 mL) was computed for all drivers. The correlates of driving under the influence were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Of the 807 professional drivers stopped, complete data for 783 were available. Almost all were men (n = 781). The mean age of drivers was 38.3 years (SD = 8.9). About one in 10 drivers (n = 77, 9.8%) tested positive for driving under the influence. About 2.8% (n = 22) had blood alcohol levels ≥ 40 mg/100 mL (legal limit in the United States) and 1.4% (n = 11) had blood alcohol levels ≥ 80 mg/100 mL. The likelihood of driving under the influence increased in drivers scoring 8 or more on Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.14-6.07) and in those having a nighttime driving schedule (aOR = 4.43; 95% CI, 1.33-14.77). These findings suggest that increasing enforcement to counter impaired driving in professional drivers in Cameroon is needed. Interventions might include screening for alcohol misuse and hazardous occupational practices.

Infectious complications in tissue expander (TE) breast reconstruction can be devastating and costly. Therefore, to optimize care, we examined patient's demographics, microbiology of TE infections, and the efficacy of empiric antimicrobial regimens and thereafter generated an algorithm for the treatment of these complex infections. We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent TE breast reconstruction between 2003 and 2012 and analyzed those patients who developed a ""definite"" device-related infection leading to TE explantation and had a positive intraoperative culture. A total of 3,082 patients underwent immediate breast reconstruction with TE. Of these, 378 patients (12.3%) developed an infection, 189 (6.1%) eventually proceed with explantation, and 118 (3.8%) had a positive intraoperative culture. Gram-positive organisms caused 73% of infections, and Gram-negative organisms caused 27% of infections. Narrow-spectrum empiric antimicrobials with predominantly Gram-positive coverage were deemed appropriate in only 62% of cases, and those with Gram-negative coverage were appropriate in 46%. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials were used in 47% of cases, mainly recommended by infectious disease specialists, and were considered appropriate in >90% of the occasions. Current empiric antibiotic regimens do not cover the vast spectrum of organisms causing TE infections. To increase the salvage rate of an infected TE, at the first sign of infection, in addition to benefiting with an infectious diseases consultation, empiric coverage with broad-spectrum antibiotics active against biofilm-embedded organisms should be administered."

Schistosomiasis, a chronic neglected tropical disease caused by Schistosoma worms, is reported in nearly 80 countries. Although the disease affects approximately 260 million people, the treatment relies exclusively on praziquantel, a drug discovered in the mid-1970s that lacks efficacy against the larval stages of the parasite. In addition, the dependence on a single treatment has raised concerns about drug resistance, and reduced susceptibility has already been found in laboratory and field isolates. Therefore, novel therapies for schistosomiasis are needed, and several approaches have been used to that end. One of these strategies, molecular modeling, has been increasingly integrated with experimental techniques, resulting in the discovery of novel antischistosomal agents.

27591653	no cancer	-1	0	A microfluidic chip for studying the reproduction of Enteromorpha prolifera. In recent years, green tides caused by water eutrophication, has brought serious environmental problems. Enteromorpha prolifera (E. prolifera), an opportunistic macroalgae, is one of the main source contributing to the formation of green tides. It has been estimated that the excessive growth of E. prolifera is closely related to various reproductive ways of germ cells which are at the micrometer scale. Here we report a microfluidic device named Germ Cell Capture Chip (GCChip) to investigate the E. prolifera reproductive mechanism. GCChip integrates the functions of algal growing, and the release, capture and selective culture of germ cells. Automatic separation and capture of germ cells on the chip allows to study germ cells' response to different stimuli. The novel device greatly facilitates long-term live-cell imaging at cellular resolution and implements the rapid and accurate exchange of growth medium without manual intervention. Results showed that the starting time of germ cell releases were earlier on the chip than that of traditional experiments with more concentrated breakout. Moreover, GCChip can be widely applied on the study of other algae. The study of algae growth process, including the elongation of somatic cell, the generation, and the release of reproductive cells, can all be improved by using this microfluidic platform.

In 2003, the German Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) initiated the national Cooperation-Network (CN) 'Equity in Health'. The CN is constantly increasing in size and scope, supporting setting approaches aimed at reducing health inequalities. A detailed description of the CN has not yet been available in English. The CN comprises a total of 66 institutional cooperation partners. Information concerning the structure and activities can be found on a special website. Coordination Centres (CC) have been established in the 16 federal states, for the coordination of all state-specific activities. Funding for the CN and CC is provided by the BZgA, the German statutory sickness funds and by the state-specific ministries of health. These partners also support the continuous quality improvement, which is based on the good-practice criteria developed by the Advisory Committee of the CN. In 2011, the 'Municipal Partner Process (MPP)' has been launched, specifically supporting local partners and integrated life-course approaches focussing on children. In 2015, the focus has been widened to include all age-groups. In July 2015, a new national health law concerning health promotion and prevention has been ratified by the federal Parliament, with a focus on reducing health inequalities. Currently, the details of its implementation are discussed on a nationwide basis. The CN has long advocated for such a law, and today the CN is a well-accepted partner providing concepts, methods and a strong and long-standing network. The article closes with future challenges faced by the CN.
27583783	no cancer	-1	0	Water-Floating Giant Nanosheets from Helical Peptide Pentamers. One of the important challenges in the development of protein-mimetic materials is understanding the sequence-specific assembly behavior and dynamic folding change. Conventional strategies for constructing two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures from peptides have been limited to using β-sheet forming sequences as building blocks due to their natural tendency to form sheet-like aggregations. We have identified a peptide sequence (YFCFY) that can form dimers via a disulfide bridge, fold into a helix, and assemble into macroscopic flat sheets at the air/water interface. Due to the large driving force for 2D assembly and high elastic modulus of the resulting sheet, the peptide assembly induces flattening of the initially round water droplet. Additionally, we found that stabilization of the helix by dimerization is a key determinant for maintaining macroscopic flatness over a few tens of centimeters even with a uniform thickness of <10 nm. Furthermore, the ability to transfer the sheets from a water droplet to another substrate allows for multiple stacking of 2D peptide nanostructures, suggesting possible applications in biomimetic catalysis, biosensors, and 2D related electronic devices.

We have extended the Universal Force Field for Metal-Organic Frameworks (UFF4MOF) to cover all moieties present in the most extensive framework library to date, i.e. the Computation-Ready Experimental (CoRE) database (Chem. Mater. 26, 6185 (2014)). Thus, we have extended the parameters to include the fourth and fifth row transition metals, lanthanides and an additional atom type for Sulphur, while the parameters of original UFF and of UFF4MOF are not modified. Employing the new parameters significantly enlarges the number of structures that may be subjected to a UFF calculation, i.e. more than doubling accessible MOFs of the CoRE structures and thus reaching over 99% of CoRE structure coverage. In turn, 95% of optimized cell parameters are within 10% of their experimental values. We contend these parameters will be most useful for the generation and rapid prototyping of hypothetical MOF structures from SBU databases.

27600575	no cancer	-1	0	HAMS: High-Affinity Mass Spectrometry Screening. A High-Throughput Screening Method for Identifying the Tightest-Binding Lead Compounds for Target Proteins with No False Positive Identifications. A major challenge in drug discovery is the identification of high affinity lead compounds that bind a particular target protein; these leads are typically identified by high throughput screens. Mass spectrometry has become a detection method of choice in drug screening assays because the target and the ligand need not be modified. Label-free assays are advantageous because they can be developed more rapidly than assays requiring labels, and they eliminate the risk of the label interfering with the binding event. However, in commonly used MS-based screening methods, detection of false positives is a major challenge. Here, we describe a detection strategy designed to eliminate false positives. In this approach, the protein and the ligands are incubated together, and the non-binders are separated for detection. Hits (protein binders) are not detectable by MS after incubation with the protein, but readily identifiable by MS when the target protein is not present in the incubation media. The assay was demonstrated using three different proteins and hundreds of non-inhibitors; no false positive hits were identified in any experiment. The assay can be tuned to select for ligands of a particular binding affinity by varying the quantity of protein used and the immobilization method. As examples, the method selectively detected inhibitors that have Ki values of 0.2 μM, 50 pM, and 700 pM. These findings demonstrate that the approach described here compares favorably with traditional MS-based screening methods. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.

We analyzed the interactions between peripheral blood lymphocytes from heterologous donors with mesenchymal stem cells obtained from the tooth pulp and trophoblast. In mixed cultures, proliferation of both lymphocytes and mesenchymal stem cells was suppressed. Similar suppressive effects were observed in lymphocyte cultures mixed with epithelial cells (hepatocytes HeG2 and renal epithelial cells HEK293). This suppression can be determined by impairment of normal adhesion contacts between cells of different origin.
27598241	no cancer	-1	0	Laparoscopic or open appendicectomy for suspected appendicitis in pregnancy and evaluation of foetal outcome in Australia. Recent data suggest that laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) in pregnancy is associated with higher rates of foetal loss when compared to open appendicectomy (OA). However, the influence of gestational age and maternal age, both recognized risk factors for foetal loss, was not assessed. This was a multicentre retrospective review of all pregnant patients who underwent appendicectomy for suspected appendicitis from 2000 to 2012 across seven hospitals in Australia. Perioperative data and foetal outcome were evaluated. Data on 218 patients from the seven hospitals were included in the analysis. A total of 125 underwent LA and 93 OA. There were seven (5.6%) foetal losses in the LA group, six of which occurred in the first trimester, and none in the OA group. After matching using propensity scores, the estimated risk difference was 5.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4%, 9.8%). First trimester patients were more likely to undergo LA (84%), while those in the third were more likely to undergo OA (85%). Preterm delivery rates (6.8% LA versus 8.6% OA; CI: -12.6%, 5.3%) and hospital length of stay (3.7 days LA versus 4.5 days OA; CI: -1.3, 0.2 days) were similar. This is the largest published dataset investigating the outcome after LA versus OA while adjusting for gestational and maternal age. OA appears to be a safer approach for pregnant patients with suspected appendicitis.

The aim of the present study was to enhance the biosorption capacity of a waste biomass of Punica granatum L. peels (PGL) using various chemical modification agents. Among these agents, hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) indicated the best performance with regards the improvement of lead(II) ions removal from aqueous solution. The characterization of HMDA modified Punica granatum L. peels (HMDA-PGL) was achieved by using elemental analysis, FT-IR, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and zeta potential measurement techniques. Based on FTIR study, the chemical modification of Punica granatum L. peels take place with its carboxyl, carbonyl, hydroxyl etc. groups and these groups are responsible for the biosorption of lead(II) ions onto modified biomass. Biosorption equilibrium and kinetic data fitted well the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic models, respectively. The highest biosorption capacity obtained from Langmuir isotherm model was 371.36 mg g(-1). Biosorption process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature according to the thermodynamic results and it was quickly reached to the equilibrium within 60 min. The validity of kinetic models used in this study can be quantitatively tested by using a normalized standard deviation Δq(%).

The importance of this temperature range for understanding the dynamics of bi- and termolecular reactions is illustrated with new results for the time-honored reaction of FeO+ with H2 using the cryogenic ion trap ISORI in Prague. The rate coefficient for forming Fe+ + H2O increases steeply with decreasing temperature. In addition more product channels open up such as the stabilized reaction intermediate H2FeO+ or Hen-FeO+ complexes formed via ternary association with He. For the FeOH+ + H channel only a minor signal is observed. The rate coefficients provide a deep insight into lifetimes, bottlenecks and barriers impeding almost completely the exothermic but spin forbidden reaction at room temperature. For some of the He-tagged ions, infrared predissociation spectra have been recorded. A breakthrough has been to obtain the first spectrum of [(H2)FeO]+, synthesized and tagged in situ with He. These results pave the way to study the structures of reaction intermediates stabilized in the gas phase via collisions with helium.
27579016	no cancer	-1	0	Anopheline species and their Plasmodium infection status in Aligarh, India. Malaria is a global issue and India contributes substantially to global malaria incidence. Information related to malaria vectors is very limited in Aligarh. The environmental and climatological situations permit the continual breeding of vectors in permanent breeding sites. This study was designed with the aim to screen all the anophelines species and possible malaria vectors in three different localities of Aligarh. Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from three different localities (Fort, Jalali and Tappal) during peak malaria transmission season (July to November) by using mouth aspirator and CDC light traps. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was done to detect Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax-210 and P. vivax-247 circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) from the collected female species. A total of 794 female anopheline mosquitoes belonging to 7 species were collected by different methods. Circumsporozoite protein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed with 780 anopheline mosquitoes out of which 13 mosquitoes were positive in CSP-ELISA. Thus, the overall infection rate was 1.66% (13/780). Four (0.51%) mosquitoes belonging to three species were positive for P. falciparum, 7 (0.89%) mosquitoes belonging to three species were positive for VK 210 and 2 (0.25%) mosquitoes belonging to Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi species were positive for VK 247. No mixed infection was found in this study. According to species, the highest infection rate was observed in An. culicifacies (7/288, 2.43%) followed by An. stephensi (2.40%) and Anopheles annularis (1.98%). An. culicifacies and An. stephensi were previously incriminated as malaria vectors in Aligarh. There was, however, no previous report in favor of infections in An. annularis in Aligarh. The on-going Malaria Control Program in India needs up to date information on malaria vectors. A major challenge is the lack of knowledge about vectors and their role in malaria transmission. Findings of this study suggested that in the absence of major malaria vectors there is a possibility that other Anopheles species may have been playing a role in malaria transmission in Aligarh.
27593553	no cancer	-1	0	Silver nanoparticles exhibit coating and dose-dependent neurotoxicity in glutamatergic neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used extensively as anti-microbial agents in various products, but little is known about their potential neurotoxic effects. In this study, we used glutamatergic neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells as a cellular model to study 20nm citrate-coated AgNPs (AgSCs) and Polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated AgNPs (AgSPs) induced neurotoxicity. AgSCs significantly damaged neurite outgrowths; increased the production of reactive oxygen species and Ca(2+) influxes; reduced the expression of MAP2, PSD95, vGlut1 and NMDA receptor proteins at concentrations as low as 0.1μg/ml. In contrast, AgSPs exhibited neurotoxicity only at higher concentration. Furthermore, our results showed that AgSCs induced glutamate excitotoxicity by the activation of calmodulin and the induction of nitric oxide synthase; increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 α/β at Tyr(216) and Tau at Ser(396) and reduced the expression of Tau46, which are typically observed in Alzheimer's disease. This study indicated that stem cells can provide an excellent platform for studying nanoparticle induced neurotoxicity.
27587301	no cancer	-1	0	Ischemic stroke patients are biologically older than their chronological age. Ischemic stroke is associated with aging. It is possible to predict chronological age by measuring age-related changes in DNA methylation from multiple CpG sites across the genome, known as biological age. The difference between biological age and actual chronological age would indicate an individual's level of aging. Our aim was to determine the biological age of ischemic stroke patients and compare their aging with controls of the same chronological age. A total of 123 individuals, 41 controls and 82 patients with ischemic stroke were paired by chronological age, ranging from 39 to 82 years. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA methylation in CpG sites in both groups, and biological age was estimated using methylation values of specific CpGs. Ischemic stroke patients were biologically an average 2.5 years older than healthy controls (p-value=0.010). Stratified by age tertiles, younger stroke patients (≤57 years old) were biologically older than controls (OR=1.19; 95%CI 1.00-1.41, p-value=0.046). The older groups showed no biological age differences between cases and controls, but were close to reaching the significance level. Ischemic stroke patients are biologically older than controls. Biological age should be considered as a potential new biomarker of stroke risk.
27593355	no cancer	-1	0	Exposure to pyrethroid pesticides and the risk of childhood brain tumors in East China. Pesticide exposure is hypothesized as one of the risk factors for the development of childhood brain tumors (CBT). This hospital-based case-control study evaluated the association of pyrethroid pesticide exposure with the risk for CBT in a children population in East China. In total, 161 CBT cases and 170 controls were recruited from 2 children's medical centers in Shanghai (Xinhua Hospital and Shanghai Children's Medical Center) between September 2012 and June 2015. The cases and controls were matched for age, sex, and province of residence. Pyrethroid pesticide exposure was evaluated by urinalysis of 3 nonspecific metabolites of pyrethroids (cis-DCCA, trans-DCCA, and 3-PBA) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection and by administering a questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression showed that trans-DCCA, 3-PBA, and total metabolites (sum of the 3 metabolites) were positively associated with the increased risk of CBT. Children in the highest quartile had a nearly 3-fold increased risk of CBT compared with those in the lowest quartile after adjusting for confounding factors (trans-DCCA, odds ratio (OR) = 2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-4.80, p = 0.003; 3-PBA, OR = 3.26, 95% CI, 1.73-6.14, p < 0.0001; total metabolites, OR = 3.60, 95% CI, 1.87-6.93, p < 0.0001). We also found that exposure to both mosquitocide and cockroach killer was related to the increased risk of CBT (mosquitocide, OR = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.06-2.67, p = 0.027; cockroach killer, OR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.13-2.95, p = 0.013). These findings indicate that exposure to pyrethroid pesticides might be associated with increased risk of CBT. Prospective cohort studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm this conclusion.

The synthesis of a donor-acceptor silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc)-azafullerene (C59 N) dyad 1 and of the first acceptor-donor-acceptor C59 N-SiPc-C59 N dumbbell triad 2 was accomplished. The two C59 N-based materials were comprehensively characterized with the aid of NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-MS as well as DFT calculations and their redox and photophysical properties were evaluated with CV and steady-state and time-resolved absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements. Notably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy assays revealed that both dyad 1 and triad 2 undergo, after selective photoexcitation of the SiPc moiety, photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the SiPc moiety to the azafullerene counterpart to produce the charge-separated state, with lifetimes of 660 ps, in the case of dyad 1, and 810 ps, in the case of triad 2. The current results are expected to have significant implications en route to the design of advanced C59 N-based donor-acceptor systems targeting energy conversion applications.

To preliminarily explore the application value of two-dimensional image technology and three-dimensional visualization technology in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) treated by associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy(ALPPS). Clinical data of nineteen HCC patients treated by ALPPS were retrospectively analyzed in Sun-Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from August 2013 to May 2015.Preoperative assessment, surgical planning and intraoperative guidance were assisted by traditional two-dimensional imaging technology(group 2D) in 15 cases, and the rest 4 cases were assisted by three-dimensional visualization technology(group 3D). Three-dimensional visualization technology offered precise, visual, and distinct images, calculated the liver volume precisely, achieved virtual simulation operations, and assisted the formulation of intraoperative decisions.The mean operation time of the first stage were(331.3±61.7)minutes and (261.3±21.4)minutes in group 2D and group 3D, and the mean volume of intraoperative bleedings were (360.7±51.9)ml and (300.0±40.8)ml, respectively.The mean operation time of the second stage were (199.3±41.0)minutes and (170.0±29.4)minutes in group 2D and group 3D, and the mean volume of intraoperative bleedings were (285.3±132.6)ml and (257.5±99.5)ml, respectively.The mean interval time between two stages of operations were (15.3±6.5)d and (13.8±5.1)d in group 2D and group 3D, and the mean hospital stays were (39.3±5.8)d and (31.5±7.5)d, respectively.There were 4 cases and 12 cases who accepted the second stage operation in group 2D and group 3D respectively.There were 7 cases(4 with grade A, 2 with grade B, 1 with grade C) and 2 cases(1 with grade A, 1 with grade B) with post-hepatectomy liver failure and 9 cases(4 with grade Ⅰ, 2 with grade Ⅱ, 1 with grade Ⅲ, 2 with grade Ⅳ) and 3 cases (1 with grade Ⅰ, 1 with grade Ⅱ, 1 with grade Ⅲ)with postoperative complications in group 2D and group 3D respectively.There were 2 cases and 0 case died after operation in group 2D and group 3D respectively.There were 3 cases and 1 case who were recurrent and 4 cases and 1 case died 6 months after surgery in group 2D and group 3D respectively. Three-dimensional visualization technology assisted the formulation of preoperative assessments and surgical planning individually and precisely, which displayed potential application value in HCC treated by ALPPS.
27602964	no cancer	-1	0	The clock gene PER1 plays an important role in regulating the clock gene network in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. The various clock genes in normal cells, through their interaction, establish a number of positive and negative feedback loops that compose a network structure. These genes play an important role in regulating normal physiological activities. The expression of clock gene PER1 is decreased in many types of cancer. PER1 is highly correlated with the initiation and progression of cancer by regulating numerous downstream genes. However, it is still unclear whether the lower expression of PER1 in cancer can influence the expression of other clock genes in the clock gene network. In this study, we used short hairpin RNA interference to knock down PER1 effectively in SCC15 human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. These cancer cells later were subcutaneously injected into the back of nude mice. We discovered that after PER1 knockdown, apoptosis was decreased and cell proliferation and in vivo tumor formation were enhanced. Quantitative real-time PCR result indicated that in vitro and in vivo cancer cells after PER1 knockdown, PER2, DEC1, DEC2, CRY1, CRY2 and NPAS2 were significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level, while PER3, TIM, RORα and REV-ERBα were significantly up-regulated. It prompts that the role of PER1 in carcinogenesis is exerted not only by regulating downstream genes, but also through the synergistic dysregulation of many other clock genes in the clock gene network.
27603917	no cancer	-1	0	Structural, Culinary, Nutritional and Anti-Nutritional Properties of High Protein, Gluten Free, 100% Legume Pasta. Wheat pasta has a compact structure built by a gluten network entrapping starch granules resulting in a low glycemic index, but is nevertheless unsuitable for gluten-intolerant people. High protein gluten-free legume flours, rich in fibers, resistant starch and minerals are thus a good alternative for gluten-free pasta production. In this study, gluten-free pasta was produced exclusively from faba, lentil or black-gram flours. The relationship between their structure, their cooking and Rheological properties and their in-vitro starch digestion was analyzed and compared to cereal gluten-free commercial pasta. Trypsin inhibitory activity, phytic acid and α-galactosides were determined in flours and in cooked pasta. All legume pasta were rich in protein, resistant starch and fibers. They had a thick but weak protein network, which is built during the pasta cooking step. This particular structure altered pasta springiness and increased cooking losses. Black-gram pasta, which is especially rich in soluble fibers, differed from faba and lentil pasta, with high springiness (0.85 vs. 0.75) and less loss during cooking. In comparison to a commercial cereal gluten-free pasta, all the legume pasta lost less material during cooking but was less cohesive and springy. Interestingly, due to their particular composition and structure, lentil and faba pasta released their starch more slowly than the commercial gluten-free pasta during the in-vitro digestion process. Anti-nutritional factors in legumes, such as trypsin inhibitory activity and α-galactosides were reduced by up to 82% and 73%, respectively, by pasta processing and cooking. However, these processing steps had a minor effect on phytic acid. This study demonstrates the advantages of using legumes for the production of gluten-free pasta with a low glycemic index and high nutritional quality.

An effective, scientifically validated, diagnostic tool helps clinicians make better, timely, and more objective medical decisions in the care of their patients. Today, the need for such tools is especially urgent in the field of wound care where patient-centric care is the goal, under ever tightening clinical budget constraints. In an era of countless ""innovative"" treatment options, that is, advanced dressings, negative pressure devices, and various debridement instruments available to the wound care clinical team, one area that has arguably languished in the past decade has been innovation in wound diagnostics. Whereas medical imaging is a mainstay in the diagnostic toolkit across many other medical fields (oncology, neurology, gastroenterology, orthopedics, etc.), the field of wound care has yet to realize the full potential that advances in imaging technologies have to offer the clinician. In this issue, the first of a series in wound imaging and diagnostics, four articles have been assembled, highlighting some of the recent advances in wound imaging technologies."
27601574	no cancer	-1	0	aroA-Deficient Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Is More Than a Metabolically Attenuated Mutant. Recombinant attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains are believed to act as powerful live vaccine carriers that are able to elicit protection against various pathogens. Auxotrophic mutations, such as a deletion of aroA, are commonly introduced into such bacteria for attenuation without incapacitating immunostimulation. In this study, we describe the surprising finding that deletion of aroA dramatically increased the virulence of attenuated Salmonella in mouse models. Mutant bacteria lacking aroA elicited increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) after systemic application. A detailed genetic and phenotypic characterization in combination with transcriptomic and metabolic profiling demonstrated that ΔaroA mutants display pleiotropic alterations in cellular physiology and lipid and amino acid metabolism, as well as increased sensitivity to penicillin, complement, and phagocytic uptake. In concert with other immunomodulating mutations, deletion of aroA affected flagellin phase variation and gene expression of the virulence-associated genes arnT and ansB Finally, ΔaroA strains displayed significantly improved tumor therapeutic activity. These results highlight the importance of a functional shikimate pathway to control homeostatic bacterial physiology. They further highlight the great potential of ΔaroA-attenuated Salmonella for the development of vaccines and cancer therapies with important implications for host-pathogen interactions and translational medicine. Recombinant attenuated bacterial vector systems based on genetically engineered Salmonella have been developed as highly potent vaccines. Due to the pathogenic properties of Salmonella, efficient attenuation is required for clinical applications. Since the hallmark study by Hoiseth and Stocker in 1981 (S. K. Hoiseth and B. A. D. Stocker, Nature 291:238-239, 1981, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/291238a0), the auxotrophic ΔaroA mutation has been generally considered safe and universally used to attenuate bacterial strains. Here, we are presenting the remarkable finding that a deletion of aroA leads to pronounced alterations of gene expression, metabolism, and cellular physiology, which resulted in increased immunogenicity, virulence, and adjuvant potential of Salmonella. These results suggest that the enhanced immunogenicity of aroA-deficient Salmonella strains might be advantageous for optimizing bacterial vaccine carriers and immunotherapy. Accordingly, we demonstrate a superior performance of ΔaroA Salmonella in bacterium-mediated tumor therapy. In addition, the present study highlights the importance of a functional shikimate pathway to sustain bacterial physiology and metabolism.
27585813	no cancer	-1	0	A β-glucosidase hyper-production Trichoderma reesei mutant reveals a potential role of cel3D in cellulase production. The conversion of cellulose by cellulase to fermentable sugars for biomass-based products such as cellulosic biofuels, biobased fine chemicals and medicines is an environment-friendly and sustainable process, making wastes profitable and bringing economic benefits. Trichoderma reesei is the well-known major workhorse for cellulase production in industry, but the low β-glucosidase activity in T. reesei cellulase leads to inefficiency in biomass degradation and limits its industrial application. Thus, there are ongoing interests in research to develop methods to overcome this insufficiency. Moreover, although β-glucosidases have been demonstrated to influence cellulase production and participate in the regulation of cellulase production, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The T. reesei recombinant strain TRB1 was constructed from T. reesei RUT-C30 by the T-DNA-based mutagenesis. Compared to RUT-C30, TRB1 displays a significant enhancement of extracellular β-glucosidase (BGL1) activity with 17-fold increase, a moderate increase of both the endoglucanase (EG) activity and the exoglucanase (CBH) activity, a minor improvement of the total filter paper activity, and a faster cellulase induction. This superiority of TRB1 over RUT-C30 is independent on carbon sources and improves the saccharification ability of TRB1 cellulase on pretreated corn stover. Furthermore, TRB1 shows better resistance to carbon catabolite repression than RUT-C30. Secretome characterization of TRB1 shows that the amount of CBH, EG and BGL in the supernatant of T. reesei TRB1 was indeed increased along with the enhanced activities of these three enzymes. Surprisingly, qRT-PCR and gene cloning showed that in TRB1 β-glucosidase cel3D was mutated through the random insertion by AMT and was not expressed. The T. reesei recombinant strain TRB1 constructed in this study is more desirable for industrial application than the parental strain RUT-C30, showing extracellular β-glucosidase hyper production, high cellulase production within a shorter time and a better resistance to carbon catabolite repression. Disruption of β-glucosidase cel3D in TRB1 was identified, which might contribute to the superiority of TRB1 over RUT-C30 and might play a role in the cellulase production. These results laid a foundation for future investigations to further improve cellulase enzymatic efficiency and reduce cost for T. reesei cellulase production.
27591323	no cancer	-1	0	Circulating Memory CD4+ T Cells Target Conserved Epitopes of Rhinovirus Capsid Proteins and Respond Rapidly to Experimental Infection in Humans. Rhinovirus (RV) is a major cause of common cold and an important trigger of acute episodes of chronic lung diseases. Antigenic variation across the numerous RV strains results in frequent infections and a lack of durable cross-protection. Because the nature of human CD4(+) T cells that target RV is largely unknown, T cell epitopes of RV capsid proteins were analyzed, and cognate T cells were characterized in healthy subjects and those infected by intranasal challenge. Peptide epitopes of the RV-A16 capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 were identified by peptide/MHC class II tetramer-guided epitope mapping, validated by direct ex vivo enumeration, and interrogated using a variety of in silico methods. Among noninfected subjects, those circulating RV-A16-specific CD4(+) T cells detected at the highest frequencies targeted 10 unique epitopes that bound to diverse HLA-DR molecules. T cell epitopes localized to conserved molecular regions of biological significance to the virus were enriched for HLA class I and II binding motifs, and constituted both species-specific (RV-A) and pan-species (RV-A, -B, and -C) varieties. Circulating epitope-specific T cells comprised both memory Th1 and T follicular helper cells, and were rapidly expanded and activated after intranasal challenge with RV-A16. Cross-reactivity was evidenced by identification of a common *0401-restricted epitope for RV-A16 and RV-A39 by tetramer-guided epitope mapping and the ability for RV-A16-specific Th1 cells to proliferate in response to their RV-A39 peptide counterpart. The preferential persistence of high-frequency RV-specific memory Th1 cells that recognize a limited set of conserved epitopes likely arises from iterative priming by previous exposures to different RV strains.
27588686	no cancer	-1	0	Cloning, Purification and Characterization of the Collagenase ColA Expressed by Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579. Bacterial collagenases differ considerably in their structure and functions. The collagenases ColH and ColG from Clostridium histolyticum and ColA expressed by Clostridium perfringens are well-characterized collagenases that cleave triple-helical collagen, which were therefore termed as ´true´ collagenases. ColA from Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) has been added to the collection of true collagenases. However, the molecular characteristics of B. cereus ColA are less understood. In this study, we identified ColA as a secreted true collagenase from B. cereus ATCC 14579, which is transcriptionally controlled by the regulon phospholipase C regulator (PlcR). B. cereus ATCC 14579 ColA was cloned to express recombinant wildtype ColA (ColAwt) and mutated to a proteolytically inactive (ColAE501A) version. Recombinant ColAwt was tested for gelatinolytic and collagenolytic activities and ColAE501A was used for the production of a polyclonal anti-ColA antibody. Comparison of ColAwt activity with homologous proteases in additional strains of B. cereus sensu lato (B. cereus s.l.) and related clostridial collagenases revealed that B. cereus ATCC 14579 ColA is a highly active peptidolytic and collagenolytic protease. These findings could lead to a deeper insight into the function and mechanism of bacterial collagenases which are used in medical and biotechnological applications.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA expression and EGFR gene dosage by quantitative PCR in tumor samples obtained from patients with gefitinib-treated non-small cell lung cancer were analyzed in order to determine the association with treatment outcome, clinical, and biological features [EGFR copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations, and EGFR protein expression]. EGFR mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in 64 patients, and EGFR gene dosage was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in 82 patients from paraffin-embedded specimens. EGFR mRNA expression was higher in responders to gefitinib as compared with nonresponders (P = 0.012). Patients with high EGFR mRNA expression (>5.01) had 43% response probability, whereas patients with low EGFR mRNA expression had 8% response probability (P = 0.006). Patients with high EGFR mRNA expression had longer median progression-free (5.3 versus 2.8 months, P = 0.028) but not overall survival (13.8 versus 10.9 months, P = 0.87). EGFR mRNA expression was higher in FISH-positive patients (P = 0.001) and in patients with positive EGFR immunostaining (P < 0.001) but not in patients with EGFR mutations (P = 0.19). EGFR gene dosage did not predict response (P = 0.54), progression-free (P = 0.73), or overall survival (P = 0.89). EGFR gene dosage was not associated with FISH positivity (P = 0.15), relative mRNA expression (P = 0.27), EGFR mutation status (P = 0.39), and EGFR protein expression (P = 0.35). EGFR mRNA expression is a predictive biomarker for response to gefitinib and to progression-free survival after gefitinib treatment. EGFR gene dosage is neither predictive for response nor progression-free nor overall survival.
27589998	no cancer	-1	0	Induction of humoral immune response to multiple recombinant Rhipicephalus appendiculatus antigens and their effect on tick feeding success and pathogen transmission. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus is the primary vector of Theileria parva, the etiological agent of East Coast fever (ECF), a devastating disease of cattle in sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that a vaccine targeting tick proteins that are involved in attachment and feeding might affect feeding success and possibly reduce tick-borne transmission of T. parva. Here we report the evaluation of a multivalent vaccine cocktail of tick antigens for their ability to reduce R. appendiculatus feeding success and possibly reduce tick-transmission of T. parva in a natural host-tick-parasite challenge model. Cattle were inoculated with a multivalent antigen cocktail containing recombinant tick protective antigen subolesin as well as two additional R. appendiculatus saliva antigens: the cement protein TRP64, and three different histamine binding proteins. The cocktail also contained the T. parva sporozoite antigen p67C. The effect of vaccination on the feeding success of nymphal and adult R. appendiculatus ticks was evaluated together with the effect on transmission of T. parva using a tick challenge model. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of the anti-tick effects of these antigens in the natural host-tick-parasite combination. In spite of evidence of strong immune responses to all of the antigens in the cocktail, vaccination with this combination of tick and parasite antigens did not appear to effect tick feeding success or reduce transmission of T. parva. The results of this study highlight the importance of early evaluation of anti-tick vaccine candidates in biologically relevant challenge systems using the natural tick-host-parasite combination.
27582466	no cancer	-1	0	Long noncoding RNA #32 contributes to antiviral responses by controlling interferon-stimulated gene expression. Despite the breadth of knowledge that exists regarding the function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in biological phenomena, the role of lncRNAs in host antiviral responses is poorly understood. Here, we report that lncRNA#32 is associated with type I IFN signaling. The silencing of lncRNA#32 dramatically reduced the level of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, resulting in sensitivity to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection. In contrast, the ectopic expression of lncRNA#32 significantly suppressed EMCV replication, suggesting that lncRNA#32 positively regulates the host antiviral response. We further demonstrated the suppressive function of lncRNA#32 in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection. lncRNA#32 bound to activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and regulated ISG expression. Our results reveal a role for lncRNA#32 in host antiviral responses.
17603485	no cancer	-1	0	Two variants on chromosome 17 confer prostate cancer risk, and the one in TCF2 protects against type 2 diabetes. We performed a genome-wide association scan to search for sequence variants conferring risk of prostate cancer using 1,501 Icelandic men with prostate cancer and 11,290 controls. Follow-up studies involving three additional case-control groups replicated an association of two variants on chromosome 17 with the disease. These two variants, 33 Mb apart, fall within a region previously implicated by family-based linkage studies on prostate cancer. The risks conferred by these variants are moderate individually (allele odds ratio of about 1.20), but because they are common, their joint population attributable risk is substantial. One of the variants is in TCF2 (HNF1beta), a gene known to be mutated in individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5. Results from eight case-control groups, including one West African and one Chinese, demonstrate that this variant confers protection against type 2 diabetes.
27602352	no cancer	-1	0	Evaluation of RSA set-up from a clinical biplane fluoroscopy system for 3D joint kinematic analysis. dinamic roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA), a technique currently based only on customized radiographic equipment, has been shown to be a very accurate method for detecting three-dimensional (3D) joint motion. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the applicability of an innovative RSA set-up for in vivo knee kinematic analysis, using a biplane fluoroscopic image system. To this end, the Authors describe the set-up as well as a possible protocol for clinical knee joint evaluation. The accuracy of the kinematic measurements is assessed. the Authors evaluated the accuracy of 3D kinematic analysis of the knee in a new RSA set-up, based on a commercial biplane fluoroscopy system integrated into the clinical environment. The study was organized in three main phases: an in vitro test under static conditions, an in vitro test under dynamic conditions reproducing a flexion-extension range of motion (ROM), and an in vivo analysis of the flexion-extension ROM. For each test, the following were calculated, as an indication of the tracking accuracy: mean, minimum, maximum values and standard deviation of the error of rigid body fitting. in terms of rigid body fitting, in vivo test errors were found to be 0.10±0.05 mm. Phantom tests in static and kinematic conditions showed precision levels, for translations and rotations, of below 0.1 mm/0.2° and below 0.5 mm/0.3° respectively for all directions. the results of this study suggest that kinematic RSA can be successfully performed using a standard clinical biplane fluoroscopy system for the acquisition of slow movements of the lower limb. a kinematic RSA set-up using a clinical biplane fluoroscopy system is potentially applicable and provides a useful method for obtaining better characterization of joint biomechanics.
27602292	no cancer	-1	0	Moderate evidence for a Lombard effect in a phylogenetically basal primate. When exposed to enhanced background noise, humans avoid signal masking by increasing the amplitude of the voice, a phenomenon termed the Lombard effect. This auditory feedback-mediated voice control has also been found in monkeys, bats, cetaceans, fish and some frogs and birds. We studied the Lombard effect for the first time in a phylogenetically basal primate, the grey mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. When background noise was increased, mouse lemurs were able to raise the amplitude of the voice, comparable to monkeys, but they did not show this effect consistently across context/individuals. The Lombard effect, even if representing a generic vocal communication system property of mammals, may thus be affected by more complex mechanisms. The present findings emphasize an effect of context, and individual, and the need for further standardized approaches to disentangle the multiple system properties of mammalian vocal communication, important for understanding the evolution of the unique human faculty of speech and language.
27586152	no cancer	-1	0	Effects of incremental ambulatory-range loading on arch height index parameters. Deformation of the medial longitudinal arch under body weight loading is often assessed using the Arch Height Index Measurement System. This system assesses change in arch height between sitting and standing, estimated to be 10% and 50% of body weight, respectively. However, body weight forces during ambulation exceed these loads, therefore limiting our understanding of arch deformation under ambulatory load ranges. Thus, the study aims were (1) to assess if sitting and standing arch height differed from that seen under 10% and 50% body weight using a force target-matching procedure, and (2) to quantify the assumed linearity of arch stiffness, measured statically, throughout an ambulatory load range. Established sitting and standing arch height measurements were taken from 25 healthy subjects, who also underwent testing from 10% to 120% body weight in sequential 10% increments. Arch deformation in sitting was less than for 10% body weight, whereas the standing and 50% condition did not differ. The incremental loading data revealed linear and curvilinear trends between arch deformation and loading through the ambulatory range, such that further deformation beyond that seen at 120% would be minimal using these procedures. These data suggest that sitting arch loads and deformation are less than those seen at 10% body weight, which affects known parameters such as arch stiffness. Further, the curvilinear trend in the arch height data suggests that most arch deformation occurs in the ambulatory load range for a healthy foot.
27596353	no cancer	-1	0	Health-related quality of life in the randomised KEYNOTE-002 study of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma. In KEYNOTE-002, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival and was associated with a better safety profile compared with chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma that progressed after ipilimumab. We present health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes from KEYNOTE-002. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or investigator-choice chemotherapy. HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 instrument. A constrained longitudinal data analysis model was implemented to assess between-arm differences in HRQoL scores. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704287. Of the 540 patients enrolled, 520 were included in the HRQoL analysis. Baseline global health status (GHS) was similar across treatment arms. Compliance rates at week 12 were 76.6% (n = 108), 82.3% (n = 121), and 86.4% (n = 133) for the control, pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W, and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arms, respectively. From baseline to week 12, GHS/HRQoL scores were maintained to a higher degree in the pembrolizumab arms compared with the chemotherapy arm (decrease of -2.6 for each pembrolizumab arm versus -9.1 for chemotherapy; P = 0.01 for each pembrolizumab arm versus chemotherapy). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab experienced deterioration in GHS at week 12 (31.8% for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 26.6% for 10 mg/kg, and 38.3% for chemotherapy), with similar trends observed for the individual functioning and symptoms scales. HRQoL was better maintained with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-002, supporting the use of pembrolizumab in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma.
16707605	cancer	162	1	Epidermal growth factor receptor messenger RNA expression, gene dosage, and gefitinib sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA expression and EGFR gene dosage by quantitative PCR in tumor samples obtained from patients with gefitinib-treated non-small cell lung cancer were analyzed in order to determine the association with treatment outcome, clinical, and biological features [EGFR copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), EGFR tyrosine kinase mutations, and EGFR protein expression]. EGFR mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in 64 patients, and EGFR gene dosage was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in 82 patients from paraffin-embedded specimens. EGFR mRNA expression was higher in responders to gefitinib as compared with nonresponders (P = 0.012). Patients with high EGFR mRNA expression (>5.01) had 43% response probability, whereas patients with low EGFR mRNA expression had 8% response probability (P = 0.006). Patients with high EGFR mRNA expression had longer median progression-free (5.3 versus 2.8 months, P = 0.028) but not overall survival (13.8 versus 10.9 months, P = 0.87). EGFR mRNA expression was higher in FISH-positive patients (P = 0.001) and in patients with positive EGFR immunostaining (P < 0.001) but not in patients with EGFR mutations (P = 0.19). EGFR gene dosage did not predict response (P = 0.54), progression-free (P = 0.73), or overall survival (P = 0.89). EGFR gene dosage was not associated with FISH positivity (P = 0.15), relative mRNA expression (P = 0.27), EGFR mutation status (P = 0.39), and EGFR protein expression (P = 0.35). EGFR mRNA expression is a predictive biomarker for response to gefitinib and to progression-free survival after gefitinib treatment. EGFR gene dosage is neither predictive for response nor progression-free nor overall survival.
27587281	no cancer	-1	0	Recent updates on molecular genetic engineering approaches and applications of human therapeutic proteins. Therapeutic proteins are engineered proteins produced in the laboratory for pharmaceutical use. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, the proteins can be generated in specific host cells under defined conditions. In the process of production of genetically engineered animals, the gene of interest can be added at a single cell stage to produce a cloned animal from genetically engineered cells. Several recombinant cytokines, clotting factors etc have been licensed and are currently being utilized for the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, hemophilia, anemia, multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis B/C. Therapeutic proteins that are useful for human are successfully produced in poultry as well as in livestock animals. However, the fastest growing class of therapeutic proteins are antibodies especially monoclonal antibodies (mAb), the most important class of therapeutic protein with the potential to generate significant revolution in terms of clinical success rate. Here, we review the most recent clinical advances in the field of emerging and existing therapeutic proteins.
27584670	no cancer	-1	0	Esophageal Perforation in a Cervical Fracture Patient with Progressed Ankylosing Spondylitis: Case Report and Review of the literature. Case report and review of relevant literature. To report a rare complication of esophageal perforation in cervical fracture patient with progressed ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and review of relevant literature. Esophageal perforation in cervical fracture is extremely rare. This complication has never been reported in AS patients. Key points in the early diagnosis and management of this severe complication along with the cervical fracture was presented in detail in this case report. A 61-year-old male with AS, who sustained C6 fracture and dislocation after a vehicle accident. Initial treatment strategy was combined anterior-posterior fixation and fusion. While esophageal perforation in the dorsal wall of esophagus was detected in anterior surgery. After thorough debridement, the esophageal lesion was closed by resorbable interrupted sutures. Surgical incision was washed by saline and hydrogen peroxide without primary closure. Cervical fracture was treated by long level posterior fixation alone. After surgery, the anterior surgical incision was irrigated with normal saline twice a day and closed 3 weeks later. Esophageal perforation was healed completely and neurologic results were improved significantly after surgery. Union of the fracture and segmental stability of cervical spine was confirmed radiologically at one-year follow-up. Esophageal perforation in cervical fracture patient with progressed AS is an extremely rare and potentially life-threatening complication. Surgical debridement and drainage with intensive care are essential for good outcome. 5.
27596953	no cancer	-1	0	p16(INK4A) induces senescence and inhibits EMT through microRNA-141/microRNA-146b-5p-dependent repression of AUF1. Senescence and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes are under the control of common tumor suppressor proteins, EMT transcription factors, and microRNAs. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate the functional link between senescence and EMT are still elusive. We have shown here that p16(INK4A) -reltaed induction of senescence is mediated through miR-141 and miR-146b-5p. These 2 microRNAs are up-regulated in aging human fibroblast and epithelial cells. Furthermore, miR-141 and miR146b-5p trigger cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and induce senescence in primary human fibroblasts and breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of p16(INK4A) . Like p16(INK4A) -induced senescence, miR-141/miR146b-5p-related senescence is not associated with secretory phenotype, and is mediated through the RNA binding protein AUF1. We have further demonstrated that p16(INK4A) and its downstream miRNA targets inhibit EMT through suppressing the EMT inducer ZEB1 in an AUF1-dependent manner. Indeed, AUF1 binds the mRNA of this gene leading to increase in its level. These results indicate that p16(INK4A) controls both senescence and EMT through repressing EMT-related transcription factor via miR-141/miR146b-5p and their target AUF1. This sheds more light on the molecular basis of the tumor suppressive functions of p16(INK4A) , which represses both the proliferative and the migratory/invasive capacities of cells.

27598991	no cancer	-1	0	Single Molecule Studies of the Diffusion of Band 3 in Sickle Cell Erythrocytes. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by an inherited mutation in hemoglobin that leads to sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and premature HbS denaturation. Previous publications have shown that HbS denaturation is followed by binding of denatured HbS (a.k.a. hemichromes) to band 3, the consequent clustering of band 3 in the plane of the erythrocyte membrane that in turn promotes binding of autologous antibodies to the clustered band 3, and removal of the antibody-coated erythrocytes from circulation. Although each step of the above process has been individually demonstrated, the fraction of band 3 that is altered by association with denatured HbS has never been determined. For this purpose, we evaluated the lateral diffusion of band 3 in normal cells, reversibly sickled cells (RSC), irreversibly sickled cells (ISC), and hemoglobin SC erythrocytes (HbSC) in order to estimate the fraction of band 3 that was diffusing more slowly due to hemichrome-induced clustering. We labeled fewer than ten band 3 molecules per intact erythrocyte with a quantum dot to avoid perturbing membrane structure and we then monitored band 3 lateral diffusion by single particle tracking. We report here that the size of the slowly diffusing population of band 3 increases in the sequence: normal cells<HbSC<RSC<ISC. We also demonstrate that the size of the compartment in which band 3 is free to diffuse decreases roughly in the same order, with band 3 diffusing in two compartments of sizes 35 and 71 nm in normal cells, but only a single compartment in HbSC cells (58 nm), RSC (45 nm) and ISC (36 nm). These data suggest that the mobility of band 3 is increasingly constrained during SCD progression, suggesting a global impact of the mutated hemoglobin on erythrocyte membrane properties.

Mononuclear Ru(III) complexes of the type [Ru(LL)Cl2(H2O)] (LL = monobasic tridentate Schiff base anion: (1Z)-N'-(2-{(E)-[1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethylidene]amino}ethyl)-N-phenylethanimidamide [DAE], 4-[(1E)-N-{2-[(Z)-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)amino]ethyl}ethanimidoyl]benzene-1,3-diol [HME], 4-[(1E)-N-{2-[(Z)-(3,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)amino]ethyl}ethanimidoyl]benzene-1,3-diol [MBE], and N-(2-{(E)-[1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethylidene]amino}ethyl)benzenecarboximidoyl chloride [DEE]) were synthesized and characterized using the microanalytical, conductivity measurements, electronic spectra, and FTIR spectroscopy. IR spectral studies confirmed that the ligands act as tridentate chelate coordinating the metal ion through the azomethine nitrogen and phenolic oxygen atom. An octahedral geometry has been proposed for all Ru(III)-Schiff base complexes. In vitro anticancer studies of the synthesized complexes against renal cancer cells (TK-10), melanoma cancer cells (UACC-62), and breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was investigated using the Sulforhodamine B assay. [Ru(DAE)Cl2(H2O)] showed the highest activity with IC50 valves of 3.57 ± 1.09, 6.44 ± 0.38, and 9.06 ± 1.18 μM against MCF-7, UACC-62, and TK-10, respectively, order of activity being TK-10 < UACC-62 < MCF-7. The antioxidant activity by DPPH and ABTS inhibition assay was also examined. Scavenging ability of the complexes on DPPH radical can be ranked in the following order: [Ru(DEE)Cl2(H2O)] > [Ru(HME)Cl2(H2O)] > [Ru(DAE)Cl2(H2O)] > [Ru(MBE)Cl2(H2O)].
27590224	no cancer	-1	0	The Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore and ATP Synthase. Mitochondrial ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation combines the stepwise oxidation by the electron transport chain (ETC) of the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2 with the generation of ATP by the ATP synthase. Recent studies show that the ATP synthase is not only essential for the generation of ATP but may also contribute to the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). We present a model, in which the PTP is located within the c-subunit ring in the Fo subunit of the ATP synthase. Opening of the PTP was long associated with uncoupling of the ETC and the initiation of programmed cell death. More recently, it was shown that PTP opening may serve a physiologic role: it can transiently open to regulate mitochondrial signaling in mature cells, and it is open in the embryonic mouse heart. This review will discuss how the ATP synthase paradoxically lies at the center of both ATP generation and cell death.
27580719	no cancer	-1	0	Structural basis of damage recognition by thymine DNA glycosylase: Key roles for N-terminal residues. Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) is a base excision repair enzyme functioning in DNA repair and epigenetic regulation. TDG removes thymine from mutagenic G·T mispairs arising from deamination of 5-methylcytosine (mC), and it processes other deamination-derived lesions including uracil (U). Essential for DNA demethylation, TDG excises 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, derivatives of mC generated by Tet (ten-eleven translocation) enzymes. Here, we report structural and functional studies of TDG(82-308), a new construct containing 29 more N-terminal residues than TDG(111-308), the construct used for previous structures of DNA-bound TDG. Crystal structures and NMR experiments demonstrate that most of these N-terminal residues are disordered, for substrate- or product-bound TDG(82-308) Nevertheless, G·T substrate affinity and glycosylase activity of TDG(82-308) greatly exceeds that of TDG(111-308) and is equivalent to full-length TDG. We report the first high-resolution structures of TDG in an enzyme-substrate complex, for G·U bound to TDG(82-308) (1.54 Å) and TDG(111-308) (1.71 Å), revealing new enzyme-substrate contacts, direct and water-mediated. We also report a structure of the TDG(82-308) product complex (1.70 Å). TDG(82-308) forms unique enzyme-DNA interactions, supporting its value for structure-function studies. The results advance understanding of how TDG recognizes and removes modified bases from DNA, particularly those resulting from deamination.
27587150	no cancer	-1	0	A magnetically actuated cellular strain assessment tool for quantitative analysis of strain induced cellular reorientation and actin alignment. Commercially available cell strain tools, such as pneumatically actuated elastomer substrates, require special culture plates, pumps, and incubator setups. In this work, we present a magnetically actuated cellular strain assessment tool (MACSAT) that can be implemented using off-the-shelf components and conventional incubators. We determine the strain field on the MACSAT elastomer substrate using numerical models and experimental measurements and show that a specific region of the elastomer substrate undergoes a quasi-uniaxial 2D stretch, and that cells confined to this region of the MACSAT elastomer substrate undergo tensile, compressive, or zero axial strain depending on their angle of orientation. Using the MACSAT to apply cyclic strain on endothelial cells, we demonstrate that actin filaments within the cells reorient away from the stretching direction, towards the directions of minimum axial strain. We show that the final actin orientation angles in strained cells are spread over a region of compressive axial strain, confirming previous findings on the existence of a varied pre-tension in the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. We also demonstrate that strained cells exhibit distinctly different values of actin alignment coherency compared to unstrained cells and therefore propose that this parameter, i.e., the coherency of actin alignment, can be used as a new readout to determine the occurrence/extent of actin alignment in cell strain experiments. The tools and methods demonstrated in this study are simple and accessible and can be easily replicated by other researchers to study the strain response of other adherent cells.
27591381	no cancer	-1	0	Pulmonary extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma: A case report and literature review. Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) accounts for the 3% of all soft tissue sarcomas and it's categorized as a tumour of uncertain differentiation. This entity has shown to have the recurrent balanced chromosomal translocation t(9;22) (q22;q12.2), which leads to the oncogenic fusion gene EWSR1-NR4A3. This sarcoma usually presents as a slow growing, palpable mass in the extremities. EMC arising from the lung is extremely infrequent. We report one case of pulmonary extraskeletal mixoid chondrosarcoma and a review of the world literature. A 69-year-old male patient presented with intermittent hemoptysis for the last 6 months. A PET/CT scan showed a hypermetabolic solid mass with lobulated borders of approximately 29×26mm in the inferior right lobe. We performed a right thoracotomy with inferior lobectomy and lymphadenectomy of levels VII, VIII, X, and XI levels. The neoplasm was constituted by cords of small cells with small round nucleus and scarce cytoplasm immerse in an abundant myxoid matrix. The immunophenotype was positive for MUM-1, CDK4, MDM2, and showed focal expression for S-100 protein and CD56. The final pathology report revealed a pulmonary extraskeletal mixoid chondrosarcoma. No further surgical interventions or adjuvant therapies were needed. EMC is an intermediate-grade neoplasm, characterized by a long clinical course with high potential for local recurrence and distant metastasis. Treatment for EMC is surgical and non-surgical treatment is reserved for recurrence or metastatic disease. Pulmonary extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is a rare neoplasm with only isolated case reports found in the literature.

Recent discoveries into the biology of this disease hold promise for identifying prognostic and predictive features and novel therapeutic targets. Surgery has been the historical standard of care but carries considerable drawbacks in terms of high local recurrence rates and poor functional outcomes. Improved understanding of the natural history of desmoid-type fibromatosis has resulted in a paradigm shift toward nonoperative management. Effective medical treatment options include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, hormone therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and targeted agents. A treatment algorithm has been proposed with the objective of optimizing treatment.
27582684	no cancer	-1	0	Knowledge about osteoporosis prevention among women screened by bone densitometry. Osteoporosis is an illness characterized by the handicapped endurance of the bones, causing an increased risk of fracture. Aim of the study was to establish the level of knowledge about osteoporosis prevention among women screened by bone densitometry and to answer the question whether the level of knowledge is dependent on socio-demographic factors. The research was realized by means of a survey method, a poll technique in 2014. The study involved 292 women aged 51-83. The examined women were patients undergoing bone densitometry in the healthcare centres in Lublin. The osteoporosis knowledge test (OKT, revised 2011) by Phyllis Gendler was used as a research tool. Gathered material was subject to descriptive and statistical analysis. Tukey's test, t-Student test and variance analysis (ANOVA) were all applied. A statistical significance level was set at α = 0.05. Respondents presented the basic exercise knowledge (M = 9.97) and low knowledge concerning risk factors, screening and treatment of osteoporosis (M = 7.87). The calcium knowledge remained on an average level (M = 14.03). Better educated women, city inhabitants as well as women having very good or good social and welfare conditions showed a significantly higher level of knowledge about osteoporosis prevention. Even women undergoing bone densitometry examination present insufficient knowledge about osteoporosis prevention.

27580545	no cancer	-1	0	Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Congenital Portosystemic Shunts Treated with Transcatheter Embolization and Pulmonary Vasodilators. Cardiopulmonary abnormalities are often present in patients with liver diseases. We herein report a case of congenital portosystemic shunts complicated by hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH). A 57-year-old woman complained of dyspnea and was subsequently diagnosed with HPS and PoPH caused by congenital portosystemic shunts. Although shunt closure by transcatheter embolization was successfully performed, her dyspnea worsened and pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance elevated. Conventional vasodilator therapy was started, resulting in an improvement of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In some patients with congenital portosystemic shunts, shunt closure could exacerbate PH, and vasodilator therapy may be effective.
27602770	no cancer	-1	0	"Biopsy-free circulating tumor DNA assay identifies actionable mutations in lung cancer. The potential of oncogene-driven targeted therapy is perhaps most fully realized in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), given the number of genomic targets and approved matched therapies. However, invasive tissue biopsy at the time of each disease progression may not be possible and is associated with high morbidity and cost. Use of newly available ""liquid biopsies"" can circumvent these issues. 83% of subjects had at least one genomic alteration identified in plasma. Most commonly mutated genes were TP53, KRAS and EGFR. Subjects with no detectable ctDNA were more likely to have small volume disease, lepidic growth pattern, mucinous tumors or isolated leptomeningeal disease. Subjects were individuals with NSCLC undergoing analysis of cell-free circulating tumor DNA using a validated, commercially-available next-generation sequencing assay at a single institution. Demographic, clinicopathologic information and results from tissue and plasma-based genomic testing were reviewed for each subject. This is the first clinic-based series of NSCLC patients assessing outcomes of targeted therapies using a commercially available ctDNA assay. Over 80% of patients had detectable ctDNA, concordance between paired tissue and blood for truncal oncogenic drivers was high and patients with biomarkers identified in plasma had PFS in the expected range. These data suggest that biopsy-free ctDNA analysis is a viable first choice when the diagnostic tissue biopsy is insufficient for genotyping or at the time of progression when a repeated invasive tissue biopsy is not possible/preferred."
27445490	cancer	162	1	Combined treatment with everolimus and fulvestrant reversed anti-HER2 resistance in a patient with refractory advanced breast cancer: a case report. Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, shows promising antitumor activity when combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer or when combined with endocrine agents for hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors. However, data are limited regarding the effect of everolimus in combination with endocrine drugs in HER2-positive advanced breast cancer regardless of the HR status. A 44-year-old female was diagnosed with recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary tumor was HR positive; however, the metastatic tumor was HR negative. The patient was resistant to classical chemotherapeutic agents and anti-HER2 treatment. Thus, the combination of everolimus and fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor downregulator, was chosen to reverse the resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Indeed, the patient experienced long-term disease stabilization. Adverse events associated with the treatment were manageable by dose adjustments. We performed genetic testing of the metastatic tumor, which harbored a PIK3CA gene mutation but was positive for phosphatase and tensin homologue expression, which might result in resistance to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. This case study indicates that combined treatment with everolimus and fulvestrant might be a viable option for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients who are HER2 positive and carry a PIK3CA gene mutation but are resistant to anti-HER2 therapy and classical chemotherapeutic agents. Further prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm this finding.
27577175	no cancer	-1	0	Alice in Wonderland syndrome associated with mycoplasma infection. Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare condition in which patients report distorted size perception of objects and their own bodies. Although specific causes and pathology have not been elucidated, an association between AIWS and infection has been suggested. To our knowledge, mycoplasma-induced AIWS has not been examined. A girl aged 7 years 11 months presented with fever (temperature, 40°C) and cough. Although the fever disappeared after approximately 10 days, she complained that her mother's face suddenly appeared smaller to her. Subsequently, she complained that objects intermittently appeared smaller than normal. Particle agglutination test indicated elevated serum antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The patient was therefore diagnosed the patient with AIWS secondary to mycoplasma infection. Although mycoplasma infection is known to cause various central nervous system symptoms, this is the first report involving AIWS, suggesting that mycoplasma could affect visual function in children.
27581788	no cancer	-1	0	Nocturia Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Compared with Other Common Chronic Diseases. The International Continence Society defines nocturia as the need to void one or more times during the night, with each of the voids preceded and followed by sleep. The chronic sleep disturbance and sleep deprivation experienced by patients with nocturia affects quality of life, compromising both mental and physical well-being. This paper aims to characterise the burden of nocturia by comparing published data from patients with nocturia with data from patients with any of 12 other common chronic conditions, specifically focusing on its impact on work productivity and activity impairment, as measured by the instrument of the same name (WPAI). A systematic literature review of multiple data sources identified evaluable studies for inclusion in the analysis. Study eligibility criteria included use of the WPAI instrument in patients with one of a predefined list of chronic conditions. We assessed the quality of each included study using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and extracted basic study information, work and activity impairment data. To assess how work and activity impairment from nocturia compares with impairment from other common chronic diseases, we conducted two data syntheses (pooled and unpooled). The number of evaluable studies and the range of overall work productivity impairment reported, respectively, were as follows: nocturia (3; 14-39 %), overactive bladder (5; 11-41 %), irritable bowel syndrome/constipation (14; 21-51 %), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (13; 6-42 %), asthma/allergies (11; 6-40 %), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (7; 19-42 %), sleep problems (3; 12-37 %), arthritis (13; 21-69 %), pain (9; 29-64 %), depression (4; 15-43 %) and gout (2; 20-37 %). The overall work productivity impairment as a result of nocturia is substantial and was found to be similar to impairment observed as a result of several other more frequently researched common chronic diseases. Greater awareness of the burden of nocturia, a highly bothersome and prevalent condition, will help policy makers and healthcare decision makers provide appropriate management of nocturia.
28029918	nervous system cancer	3093	1	Activity of Selumetinib in Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Plexiform Neurofibromas. Effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas, which are characterized by elevated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886), an oral selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1-related neurofibroma. Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the plexiform neurofibroma. A total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5) with a median tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib. Patients were able to receive selumetinib on a long-term basis; the median number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). The maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended adult dose). The most common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash, gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. The results of pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this trial were similar to those published for adults. Treatment with selumetinib resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor volume decreases from baseline of ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). Disease progression (tumor volume increase from baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. Anecdotal evidence of decreases in tumor-related pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed. Our early-phase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from long-term dose-adjusted treatment with selumetinib without having excess toxic effects.

It incorporates the deployment of a transcatheter valve in the mitral position under full endoscopic vision, combined with endoscopic mitral repair techniques that secure valve positioning and reduce the risk of paravalvular leak. This approach could be used as a rescue procedure in centres with experience in transcatheter and endoscopic valve techniques.
27589894	no cancer	-1	0	Light pollution reduces activity, food consumption and growth rates in a sandy beach invertebrate. The continued growth of human activity and infrastructure has translated into a widespread increase in light pollution. Natural daylight and moonlight cycles play a fundamental role for many organisms and ecological processes, so an increase in light pollution may have profound effects on communities and ecosystem services. Studies assessing ecological light pollution (ELP) effects on sandy beach organisms have lagged behind the study of other sources of disturbance. Hence, we assessed the influence of this stressor on locomotor activity, foraging behavior, absorption efficiency and growth rate of adults of the talitrid amphipod Orchestoidea tuberculata. In the field, an artificial light system was assembled to assess the local influence of artificial light conditions on the amphipod's locomotor activity and use of food patches in comparison to natural (ambient) conditions. Meanwhile in the laboratory, two experimental chambers were set to assess amphipod locomotor activity, consumption rates, absorption efficiency and growth under artificial light in comparison to natural light-dark cycles. Our results indicate that artificial light have significantly adverse effects on the activity patterns and foraging behavior of the amphipods, resulting on reduced consumption and growth rates. Given the steady increase in artificial light pollution here and elsewhere, sandy beach communities could be negatively affected, with unexpected consequences for the whole ecosystem.
27594427	no cancer	-1	0	Polar Positioning of Phase-Separated Liquid Compartments in Cells Regulated by an mRNA Competition Mechanism. P granules are non-membrane-bound RNA-protein compartments that are involved in germline development in C. elegans. They are liquids that condense at one end of the embryo by localized phase separation, driven by gradients of polarity proteins such as the mRNA-binding protein MEX-5. To probe how polarity proteins regulate phase separation, we combined biochemistry and theoretical modeling. We reconstitute P granule-like droplets in vitro using a single protein PGL-3. By combining in vitro reconstitution with measurements of intracellular concentrations, we show that competition between PGL-3 and MEX-5 for mRNA can regulate the formation of PGL-3 droplets. Using theory, we show that, in a MEX-5 gradient, this mRNA competition mechanism can drive a gradient of P granule assembly with similar spatial and temporal characteristics to P granule assembly in vivo. We conclude that gradients of polarity proteins can position RNP granules during development by using RNA competition to regulate local phase separation.
27583068	no cancer	-1	0	Association of tuberculosis and diabetes Mellitus: an analysis of 1000 consecutively admitted cases in a tertiary care hospital of North India. The association of Tuberculosis and Diabetes Mellitus is a cause of concern for the health sector. The coexistence of these two highly prevalent diseases has made the already existing treatments very complex. This issue is of particular significance to developing countries like India that bear a significant burden of these two diseases. Retrospective analysis of 1000 consecutively admitted patients in a tertiary care hospital were analyzed for the coexistence of Tuberculosis and Diabetes Mellitus. The study found that a significant proportion of diabetic patients had coexistent tuberculosis (65.5%). Rural population was predominantly affected in both the genders. The study observed that the coexistence of these two conditions increased with advanced age. The coexistence of Diabetes Mellitus with Tuberculosis needs to identified early and adequately addressed. The rural population needs to be educated about these two conditions and seek timely medical care.
27586662	no cancer	-1	0	Copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), an antioxidant gene from seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis); molecular cloning, sequence characterization, antioxidant activity and potential peroxidation function of its recombinant protein. Copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaCuZnSOD) is a metalloenzyme which belongs to the ubiquitous family of SODs. Here, we determined the characteristic structural features of HaCuZnSOD, analyzed its evolutionary relationships, and identified its potential immune responses and biological functions in relation to antioxidant defense mechanisms in the seahorse. The gene had a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 67 bp, a coding sequence of 465 bp and a 3' UTR of 313 bp. The putative peptide consists of 154 amino acids. HaCuZnSOD had a predicted molecular mass of 15.94 kDa and a theoretical pI value of 5.73, which is favorable for copper binding activity. In silico analysis revealed that HaCuZnSOD had a prominent Cu-Zn_superoxide_dismutase domain, two Cu/Zn signature sequences, a putative N-glycosylation site, and several active sites including Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) binding sites. The three dimensional structure indicated a β-sheet barrel with 8 β-sheets and two short α-helical regions. Multiple alignment analyses revealed many conserved regions and active sites among its orthologs. The highest amino acid identity to HaCuZnSOD was found in Siniperca chuatsi (87.4%), while Maylandia zebra shared a close relationship in the phylogenetic analysis. Functional assays were performed to assess the antioxidant, biophysical and biochemical properties of overexpressed recombinant (r) HaCuZnSOD. A xanthine/XOD assay gave optimum results at pH 9 and 25 °C indicating these may be the best conditions for its antioxidant action in the seahorse. An MTT assay and flow cytometry confirmed that rHaCuZnSOD showed peroxidase activity in the presence of HCO3(-). In all the functional assays, the level of antioxidant activity of rHaCuZnSOD was concentration dependent; metal ion supplementation also increased its activity. The highest mRNA expressional level of HaCuZnSOD was found in blood. Temporal assessment under pathological stress showed a delay response by HaCuZnSOD. Our findings demonstrated that HaCuZnSOD is an important antioxidant, which might be involved in the host antioxidant defense mechanism against oxidative stress.
27590549	no cancer	-1	0	MoS2/Ag nanohybrid: A novel matrix with synergistic effect for small molecule drugs analysis by negative-ion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This paper reports a facile synthesis of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets/silver nanoparticles (MoS2/Ag) hybrid and its use as an effective matrix in negative ion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The nanohybrid exerts a strong synergistic effect, leading to high performance detection of small molecule analytes including amino acids, peptides, fatty acids and drugs. The enhancement of laser desorption/ionization (LDI) efficiency is largely attributed to the high surface roughness and large surface area for analyte adsorption, better dispersibility, increased thermal conductivity and enhanced UV energy absorption as compared to pure MoS2. Moreover, both Ag nanoparticles and the edge of the MoS2 layers function as deprotonation sites for proton capture, facilitating the charging process in negative ion mode and promoting formation of negative ions. As a result, the MoS2/Ag nanohybrid proves to be a highly attractive matrix in MALDI-TOF MS, with desired features such as high desorption/ionization efficiency, low fragmentation interference, high salt tolerance, and no sweet-spots for mass signal. These characteristic properties allowed for simultaneous analysis of eight different drugs and quantification of acetylsalicylic acid in the spiked human serum. This work demonstrates for the first time the fabrication and application of a novel MoS2/Ag hybrid, and provides a new platform for use in the rapid and high throughput analysis of small molecules by mass spectrometry.
27577787	no cancer	-1	0	Direct 16S rRNA-seq from bacterial communities: a PCR-independent approach to simultaneously assess microbial diversity and functional activity potential of each taxon. The analysis of environmental microbial communities has largely relied on a PCR-dependent amplification of genes entailing species identity as 16S rRNA. This approach is susceptible to biases depending on the level of primer matching in different species. Moreover, possible yet-to-discover taxa whose rRNA could differ enough from known ones would not be revealed. DNA-based methods moreover do not provide information on the actual physiological relevance of each taxon within an environment and are affected by the variable number of rRNA operons in different genomes. To overcome these drawbacks we propose an approach of direct sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA without any primer- or PCR-dependent step. The method was tested on a microbial community developing in an anammox bioreactor sampled at different time-points. A conventional PCR-based amplicon pyrosequencing was run in parallel. The community resulting from direct rRNA sequencing was highly consistent with the known biochemical processes operative in the reactor. As direct rRNA-seq is based not only on taxon abundance but also on physiological activity, no comparison between its results and those from PCR-based approaches can be applied. The novel principle is in this respect proposed not as an alternative but rather as a complementary methodology in microbial community studies.
27589478	no cancer	-1	0	High expression of the Notch ligand Jagged-1 is associated with poor prognosis after surgery for colorectal cancer. The importance of Notch signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis and progression has previously been presented. Increased expression of Jagged-1 (JAG1), a Notch ligand, in CRC has been revealed, but the detailed prognostic significance of JAG1 in CRC has not been determined. Protein expression of JAG1 was examined using immunohistochemistry in 158 CRC specimens. Expression of JAG1 and E-cadherin and their associations with clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were evaluated. In vitro studies using compounds to regulate intracellular signaling and small interfering RNA to silence JAG1 were performed in a colon cancer cell line. JAG1 expression in cancerous tissues was weak, moderate, or strong in 32, 36, and 32% of specimens, respectively, and correlated with histologic type and T stage. In multivariate analysis, JAG1 expression, histologic type, and lymphatic invasion independently correlated with OS and RFS. Combination of high JAG1 expression and low E-cadherin expression had an additive effect toward poorer OS and RFS compared with the low JAG1/high E-cadherin expression subtype. A significant correlation between JAG1 expression and KRAS status was detected in groups stratified as high E-cadherin expression. In vitro studies suggested that RAS-MEK-MAP kinase and the Wnt pathways positively regulated JAG1 expression. Gene silencing with siJAG1 indicated that JAG1 promotes the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal characteristics and cell growth. High expression of JAG1 is regulated by various pathways and associated with poor prognosis through promoting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation or maintaining of cell survival in CRC.

27588098	no cancer	-1	0	Separation of cordycepin from Cordyceps militaris fermentation supernatant using preparative HPLC and evaluation of its antibacterial activity as an NAD(+)-dependent DNA ligase inhibitor. Cordycepin exhibits various bio-activities, including anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral and immune regulation activities, and is a significant focus of research. However, the preparation of high-purity cordycepin remains challenging. Also, the molecular target with which cordycepin interacts to cause an antibacterial effect remains unknown. In the present study, cordycepin was prepared by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) and the purity obtained was 99.6%, indicating that this technique may be useful for the large-scale isolation of cordycepin in the future. The results of computational molecular docking analysis indicated that the interaction energy between cordycepin and NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) was lower than that between cordycepin and other common antibacterial targets. The highly pure cordycepin obtained by prep-HPLC demonstrated inhibitory activity against LigA from various bacteria in vitro. In conclusion, cordycepin may be useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic targeting LigA in various bacteria.
8441429	nervous system cancer	3093	1	Association between high levels of expression of the TRK gene and favorable outcome in human neuroblastoma. The nerve growth factor receptor is expressed in some neuroblastomas, in which its primary component is encoded by the TRK protooncogene. To determine the relation of the expression of TRK messenger RNA in neuroblastomas to other clinical and laboratory variables, we studied frozen tumor samples from 77 patients. In addition, we tested two primary neuroblastomas that expressed TRK for responsiveness to nerve growth factor. TRK expression strongly correlated with favorable tumor stage (I, II, and IVS vs. III and IV), younger age (< 1 year vs. > or = 1 year), normal N-myc copy number, and low level of N-myc expression. N-myc amplification (indicated by a high copy number) correlated with advanced tumor stage, older age, an adrenal site of the primary tumor, low level of expression of TRK, and high level of expression of N-myc. Analysis of five-year cumulative-survival rates demonstrated an association of a very favorable outcome with a high level of TRK expression (86 percent vs. 14 percent) and with normal N-myc copy number (84 percent vs. 0 percent). Univariate analysis showed that these two variables were the most powerful predictors of outcome (chi-square = 51.30, P < 0.001; and chi-square = 93.61, P < 0.001, respectively). TRK expression still had significant prognostic value when the analysis was restricted to tumors without N-myc amplification. In primary cultures of neuroblastoma cells expressing TRK, exposure to nerve growth factor induced early gene expression and neurite outgrowth, but deprivation of nerve growth factor led to neuronal cell death. A high level of expression of the TRK proto-oncogene in a neuroblastoma is strongly predictive of a favorable outcome. A tumor with a functional nerve growth factor receptor may be dependent on the neurotrophin nerve growth factor for survival and may regress in its absence, allowing a new approach to the treatment of certain patients with neuroblastoma.
11423618	organ system cancer	50686	1	Clinical resistance to STI-571 cancer therapy caused by BCR-ABL gene mutation or amplification. Clinical studies with the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 in chronic myeloid leukemia demonstrate that many patients with advanced stage disease respond initially but then relapse. Through biochemical and molecular analysis of clinical material, we find that drug resistance is associated with the reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction in all cases examined. In six of nine patients, resistance was associated with a single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This substitution of threonine with isoleucine was sufficient to confer STI-571 resistance in a reconstitution experiment. In three patients, resistance was associated with progressive BCR-ABL gene amplification. These studies provide evidence that genetically complex cancers retain dependence on an initial oncogenic event and suggest a strategy for identifying inhibitors of STI-571 resistance.
26812297	cancer	162	1	Sunitinib treatment for multifocal renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in patient with Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Case Report. Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal, dominant, hereditary disease occurring in approximately one in 36,000 births. VHL disease produces a variety of tumors and cysts in the central nervous system and visceral organs. Surgical management, when possible, improves prognosis and extends patient's life. When surgery is impossible, treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors demonstrates encouraging response rates. We present a 60-year old patient with coexistence of multifocal renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in VHL disease, who received Sunitinib as the best option of treatment. Progression - free survival time is over 4 years. Regarding her acceptable tolerance for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, medical treatment is continued. RCC and pancreatic NET associated with VHL are responsive to Sunitinib for prolonged periods of time. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment for patients with multiple neoplasms associated with VHL disease may too be considered. Sunitinib showed acceptable toxicity.
27601343	no cancer	-1	0	Potential impact of dengue vaccination: Insights from two large-scale phase III trials with a tetravalent dengue vaccine. A tetravalent dengue vaccine demonstrated its protective efficacy in two phase III efficacy studies. Results from these studies were used to derive vaccination impact in the five Asian (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and the five Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico) participating in these trials. Vaccination impact was investigated with an age-structured, host-vector, serotype-specific compartmental model. Parameters related to vaccine efficacy and levels of dengue transmission were estimated using data collected during the phase III efficacy studies. Several vaccination programs, including routine vaccination at different ages with and without large catch-up campaigns, were investigated. All vaccination programs explored translated into significant reductions in dengue cases at the population level over the first 10years following vaccine introduction and beyond. The most efficient age for vaccination varied according to transmission intensity and 9years was close to the most efficient age across all settings. The combination of routine vaccination and large catch-up campaigns was found to enable a rapid reduction of dengue burden after vaccine introduction. Our analysis suggests that dengue vaccination can significantly reduce the public health impact of dengue in countries where the disease is endemic.
