27593208	no cancer	-1	0	Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of multiple sweet mogrosides in the fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii and its marketed sweeteners. A high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of eight major sweet mogrosides in different batches of the fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii and its marketed sweeteners. The sample preparation procedure and chromatographic and mass spectrographic conditions were optimized. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a reversed-phase Poroshell 120 SB C18 column in 10.0 min with gradient elution with acetonitrile and water, both of which contained 0.1% formic acid. The multiple reaction monitoring scanning mode was employed for quantification in the negative ion mode. The developed method was validated with acceptable linearity (r(2) = 0.9984-0.9998) over a wide concentration range, precision (relative standard deviations = 1.09-3.91%), stability (relative standard deviations = 1.21-3.01%), and recovery in the range of 91.22-106.58% (relative standard deviations ≤ 3.79%) under optimum conditions. The proposed method was demonstrated to be simple, rapid, specific and reliable and was successfully applied for the quality control of the fruits of S. grosvenorii and its marketed sweeteners.

27576331	no cancer	-1	0	How is the ultrasound in rheumatology used, implemented, and applied in Latin American centers? Results from a multicenter study. This study aimed to perform an overview of how ultrasound (US) is being used, implemented, and applied in rheumatologic centers in Latin America (LA). A retrospective, multicenter 1-year experience study was undertaken. Eighteen centers from eight countries were involved. The following information were collected: demographic data, indication to perform an US examination, physician that required the examination, and the anatomical region required for the examination. A total of 7167 patients underwent an US examination. The request for US examinations came most frequently from their own institution (5981 (83.45 %)) than from external referral (1186 (16.55 %)). The services that more frequently requested an US examination were rheumatology 5154 (71.91 %), followed by orthopedic 1016 (14.18 %), and rehabilitation 375 (5.23 %). The most frequently scanned area was the shoulder in 1908 cases (26.62 %), followed by hand 1754 (24.47 %), knee 1518 (21.18 %), ankle 574 (8.01 %), and wrist 394 (5.50 %). Osteoarthritis was the most common disease assessed (2279 patients (31.8 %)), followed by rheumatoid arthritis (2125 patients (29.65 %)), psoriatic arthritis (869 patients (12.1 %)), painful shoulder syndrome (545 (7.6 %)), connective tissue disorders (systemic sclerosis 339 (4.7 %), polymyositis/dermatomyositis 107 (1.4 %), Sjögren's syndrome 60 (0.8 %), and systemic lupus erythematosus 57 (0.8 %)). US evaluation was more frequently requested for diagnostic purposes (3981 (55.5 %)) compared to follow-up studies (2649 (36.9 %)), research protocols (339 (4.73 %)), and invasive guided procedures (198 (2.76 %)). US registered increasing applications in rheumatology and highlighted its positive impact in daily clinical practice. US increases the accuracy of the musculoskeletal clinical examination, influence the diagnosis, and the disease management.
27600056	no cancer	-1	0	Liver transplantation for acute liver failure accompanied by severe acute pancreatitis. The role of liver transplantation (LT) in acute liver failure (ALF) complicated by severe acute pancreatitis is still unclear. We here report a case of deceased-donor LT for idiopathic ALF accompanied by severe acute pancreatitis. A 58-year-old man with no history of liver disease presented with idiopathic ALF and acute pancreatitis. After careful consideration, he received a liver from a deceased donor. Following surgery, the patient's liver function rapidly reverted to normal level and the acute pancreatitis simultaneously subsided. The patient later developed a pancreatic pseudocyst, which was treated successfully with combination interventional radiology. LT can be considered for ALF associated with severe acute pancreatitis if there is no clinical evidence of an absolute contraindication for organ transplantation, such as systemic or local infection. Moreover, we recommend a close follow-up by ultrasonography to allow early detection and treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts following surgery.
21502544	cancer	162	1	Cetuximab plus irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer: updated analysis of overall survival according to tumor KRAS and BRAF mutation status. The addition of cetuximab to irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was shown to reduce the risk of disease progression and increase the chance of response in patients with KRAS wild-type disease. An updated survival analysis, including additional patients analyzed for tumor mutation status, was undertaken. Patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI with or without cetuximab. DNA was extracted from additional slide-mounted tumor samples previously used to assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Clinical outcome according to the tumor mutation status of KRAS and BRAF was assessed in the expanded patient series. The ascertainment rate of patients analyzed for tumor KRAS status was increased from 45% to 89%, with mutations detected in 37% of tumors. The addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI in patients with KRAS wild-type disease resulted in significant improvements in overall survival (median, 23.5 v 20.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.796; P = .0093), progression-free survival (median, 9.9 v 8.4 months; HR, 0.696; P = .0012), and response (rate 57.3% v 39.7%; odds ratio, 2.069; P < .001) compared with FOLFIRI alone. Significant interactions between KRAS status and treatment effect were noted for all key efficacy end points. KRAS mutation status was confirmed as a powerful predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI. BRAF tumor mutation was a strong indicator of poor prognosis. The addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI as first-line therapy improves survival in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC. BRAF tumor mutation is an indicator of poor prognosis.
27583068	no cancer	-1	0	Association of tuberculosis and diabetes Mellitus: an analysis of 1000 consecutively admitted cases in a tertiary care hospital of North India. The association of Tuberculosis and Diabetes Mellitus is a cause of concern for the health sector. The coexistence of these two highly prevalent diseases has made the already existing treatments very complex. This issue is of particular significance to developing countries like India that bear a significant burden of these two diseases. Retrospective analysis of 1000 consecutively admitted patients in a tertiary care hospital were analyzed for the coexistence of Tuberculosis and Diabetes Mellitus. The study found that a significant proportion of diabetic patients had coexistent tuberculosis (65.5%). Rural population was predominantly affected in both the genders. The study observed that the coexistence of these two conditions increased with advanced age. The coexistence of Diabetes Mellitus with Tuberculosis needs to identified early and adequately addressed. The rural population needs to be educated about these two conditions and seek timely medical care.
27586662	no cancer	-1	0	Copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), an antioxidant gene from seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis); molecular cloning, sequence characterization, antioxidant activity and potential peroxidation function of its recombinant protein. Copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaCuZnSOD) is a metalloenzyme which belongs to the ubiquitous family of SODs. Here, we determined the characteristic structural features of HaCuZnSOD, analyzed its evolutionary relationships, and identified its potential immune responses and biological functions in relation to antioxidant defense mechanisms in the seahorse. The gene had a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 67 bp, a coding sequence of 465 bp and a 3' UTR of 313 bp. The putative peptide consists of 154 amino acids. HaCuZnSOD had a predicted molecular mass of 15.94 kDa and a theoretical pI value of 5.73, which is favorable for copper binding activity. In silico analysis revealed that HaCuZnSOD had a prominent Cu-Zn_superoxide_dismutase domain, two Cu/Zn signature sequences, a putative N-glycosylation site, and several active sites including Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) binding sites. The three dimensional structure indicated a β-sheet barrel with 8 β-sheets and two short α-helical regions. Multiple alignment analyses revealed many conserved regions and active sites among its orthologs. The highest amino acid identity to HaCuZnSOD was found in Siniperca chuatsi (87.4%), while Maylandia zebra shared a close relationship in the phylogenetic analysis. Functional assays were performed to assess the antioxidant, biophysical and biochemical properties of overexpressed recombinant (r) HaCuZnSOD. A xanthine/XOD assay gave optimum results at pH 9 and 25 °C indicating these may be the best conditions for its antioxidant action in the seahorse. An MTT assay and flow cytometry confirmed that rHaCuZnSOD showed peroxidase activity in the presence of HCO3(-). In all the functional assays, the level of antioxidant activity of rHaCuZnSOD was concentration dependent; metal ion supplementation also increased its activity. The highest mRNA expressional level of HaCuZnSOD was found in blood. Temporal assessment under pathological stress showed a delay response by HaCuZnSOD. Our findings demonstrated that HaCuZnSOD is an important antioxidant, which might be involved in the host antioxidant defense mechanism against oxidative stress.
28441429	nervous system cancer	3093	1	Association between high levels of expression of the TRK gene and favorable outcome in human neuroblastoma. The nerve growth factor receptor is expressed in some neuroblastomas, in which its primary component is encoded by the TRK protooncogene. To determine the relation of the expression of TRK messenger RNA in neuroblastomas to other clinical and laboratory variables, we studied frozen tumor samples from 77 patients. In addition, we tested two primary neuroblastomas that expressed TRK for responsiveness to nerve growth factor. TRK expression strongly correlated with favorable tumor stage (I, II, and IVS vs. III and IV), younger age (< 1 year vs. > or = 1 year), normal N-myc copy number, and low level of N-myc expression. N-myc amplification (indicated by a high copy number) correlated with advanced tumor stage, older age, an adrenal site of the primary tumor, low level of expression of TRK, and high level of expression of N-myc. Analysis of five-year cumulative-survival rates demonstrated an association of a very favorable outcome with a high level of TRK expression (86 percent vs. 14 percent) and with normal N-myc copy number (84 percent vs. 0 percent). Univariate analysis showed that these two variables were the most powerful predictors of outcome (chi-square = 51.30, P < 0.001; and chi-square = 93.61, P < 0.001, respectively). TRK expression still had significant prognostic value when the analysis was restricted to tumors without N-myc amplification. In primary cultures of neuroblastoma cells expressing TRK, exposure to nerve growth factor induced early gene expression and neurite outgrowth, but deprivation of nerve growth factor led to neuronal cell death. A high level of expression of the TRK proto-oncogene in a neuroblastoma is strongly predictive of a favorable outcome. A tumor with a functional nerve growth factor receptor may be dependent on the neurotrophin nerve growth factor for survival and may regress in its absence, allowing a new approach to the treatment of certain patients with neuroblastoma.
11423618	organ system cancer	50686	1	Clinical resistance to STI-571 cancer therapy caused by BCR-ABL gene mutation or amplification. Clinical studies with the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 in chronic myeloid leukemia demonstrate that many patients with advanced stage disease respond initially but then relapse. Through biochemical and molecular analysis of clinical material, we find that drug resistance is associated with the reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction in all cases examined. In six of nine patients, resistance was associated with a single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This substitution of threonine with isoleucine was sufficient to confer STI-571 resistance in a reconstitution experiment. In three patients, resistance was associated with progressive BCR-ABL gene amplification. These studies provide evidence that genetically complex cancers retain dependence on an initial oncogenic event and suggest a strategy for identifying inhibitors of STI-571 resistance.
26812297	cancer	162	1	Sunitinib treatment for multifocal renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in patient with Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Case Report. Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal, dominant, hereditary disease occurring in approximately one in 36,000 births. VHL disease produces a variety of tumors and cysts in the central nervous system and visceral organs. Surgical management, when possible, improves prognosis and extends patient's life. When surgery is impossible, treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors demonstrates encouraging response rates. We present a 60-year old patient with coexistence of multifocal renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in VHL disease, who received Sunitinib as the best option of treatment. Progression - free survival time is over 4 years. Regarding her acceptable tolerance for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, medical treatment is continued. RCC and pancreatic NET associated with VHL are responsive to Sunitinib for prolonged periods of time. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment for patients with multiple neoplasms associated with VHL disease may too be considered. Sunitinib showed acceptable toxicity.
27601343	no cancer	-1	0	Potential impact of dengue vaccination: Insights from two large-scale phase III trials with a tetravalent dengue vaccine. A tetravalent dengue vaccine demonstrated its protective efficacy in two phase III efficacy studies. Results from these studies were used to derive vaccination impact in the five Asian (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) and the five Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico) participating in these trials. Vaccination impact was investigated with an age-structured, host-vector, serotype-specific compartmental model. Parameters related to vaccine efficacy and levels of dengue transmission were estimated using data collected during the phase III efficacy studies. Several vaccination programs, including routine vaccination at different ages with and without large catch-up campaigns, were investigated. All vaccination programs explored translated into significant reductions in dengue cases at the population level over the first 10years following vaccine introduction and beyond. The most efficient age for vaccination varied according to transmission intensity and 9years was close to the most efficient age across all settings. The combination of routine vaccination and large catch-up campaigns was found to enable a rapid reduction of dengue burden after vaccine introduction. Our analysis suggests that dengue vaccination can significantly reduce the public health impact of dengue in countries where the disease is endemic.
